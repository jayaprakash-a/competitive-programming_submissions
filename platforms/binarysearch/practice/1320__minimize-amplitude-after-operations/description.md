# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums`. Consider an operation where you pick any number in `nums` and

- If the number is even, divide it by two.
- Otherwise, multiply it by two.

Given that you can make any number of operations, return the minimum `max(nums) - min(nums)` value possible.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
