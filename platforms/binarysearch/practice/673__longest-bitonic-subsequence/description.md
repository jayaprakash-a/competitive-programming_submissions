# Description

A sequence is called bitonic if it's strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing. A sequence that is only strictly increasing is bitonic. Also, a sequence that is only strictly decreasing is bitonic.

Given a list of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest bitonic [subsequence]{data-definition=subsequence-list-integer}.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`.
