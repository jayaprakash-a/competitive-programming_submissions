# Description

You are given two lowercase alphabet strings `s` and `t`. Return the minimum number of times we must concatenate `s` such that `t` is a subsequence of `s`. For example, if we concatenate `"abc"` three times, we'd get `"abcabcabc"`. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s`
- `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `t`
