# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `graph`, representing an undirected graph by an adjacency list. The graph is a set of disjoint trees.

You can add a certain amount of edges to the forest such that it becomes a tree. Return the minimum distance possible of the longest path between any two nodes.



**Constraints**

- `n ≤ 100,000`, where `n` is the number of nodes
- `e ≤ 100,000`, where `e` is the number of edges
