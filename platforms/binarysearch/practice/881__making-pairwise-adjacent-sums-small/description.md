# Description

You are given a list of non-negative integers `nums` and a non-negative integer `k`. Consider an operation where we select a single positive integer in `nums` and decrement it by `1`.

Compute the minimum number of operations required such that every pair of adjacent values in the list sums to `≤ k`. Return the result mod `10 ** 9 + 7`.

**Constraints**
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `0 ≤ k ≤ 10 ** 9`
- `0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10 ** 9` for all `0 ≤ i < n`
