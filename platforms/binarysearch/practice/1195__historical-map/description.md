# Description

Implement a historical hash table following methods:

- `HistoricalMap()` constructs a new instance of a historical map.
- `set(int key, int val, in timestamp)` updates the key `key` with value `val` at time `timestamp`. 
- `get(int key, int timestamp)` retrieves the value that was associated with the key `key` at `timestamp`. If there is no key that was set at this time, then return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `get` and `set`.
