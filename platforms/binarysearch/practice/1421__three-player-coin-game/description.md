# Description

You are given a list of non-negative integers `piles` where each `piles[i]` represents the number of coins on pile `i`. In each move, you can do the following until there's no more coins:

- Pick any `3` piles from `piles`
- A friend will take the pile with the maximum number of coins
- You will take the next highest pile
- A friend will take the last pile

Return the maximum number of coins you can acquire.

**Constraints**
- `3 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `piles
- `n % 3 = 0`
