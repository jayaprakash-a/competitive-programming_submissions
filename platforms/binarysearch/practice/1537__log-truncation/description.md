# Description

You are given a list of integers `logs` and an integer `limit`. Each element in `logs[i]` represents the size of logs generated by user `i`. `limit` represents the total size of logs you can store in your system.

Return the largest `x` such that if we truncate every log in `logs` to be at most size `x`, the sum of the remaining log sizes is at most `limit`. If no log needs to be truncated, return the largest log size.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `logs`
- `1 ≤ limit < 2 ** 31`
