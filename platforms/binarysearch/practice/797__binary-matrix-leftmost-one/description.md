# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix` which contains `1`s and `0`s. Given that each row is sorted in ascending order with `0`s coming before `1`s, return the leftmost column index with the value of `1`. If there's no row with a `1`, return `-1`.

Can you solve it faster than `$\mathcal{O}(nm)$`.

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
