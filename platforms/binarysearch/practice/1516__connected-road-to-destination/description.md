# Description

You are given integers `sx`, `sy`, `ex`, `ey` and two-dimensional list of integers `roads`. You are currently located at coordinate `(sx, sy)` and want to move to destination `(ex, ey)`. Each element in `roads` contains `(x, y)` which is a road that will be added at that coordinate. Roads are added one by one in order. You can only move to adjacent (up, down, left, right) coordinates if there is a road in that coordinate or if it's the destination coordinate. For example, at `(x, y)` we can move to `(x + 1, y)` if `(x + 1, y)` is a road or the destination.

Return the minimum number of roads in order that must be added before there is a path consisting of roads that allows us to get to `(ex, ey)` from `(sx, sy)`. If there is no solution, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `roads`
