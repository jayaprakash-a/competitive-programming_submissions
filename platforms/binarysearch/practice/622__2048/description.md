# Description

In the game 2048, you are given a 4 by 4 board of numbers (some of them empty, represented in our case with `0`) which you can swipe in any of the 4 directions (`"up"`, `"down"`, `"left"`, or `"right"`). When you swipe, all the numbers move in that direction as far as possible and identical adjacent numbers are combined to form their sum exactly once. Given a 2D matrix of integers `board` representing the initial board and a string `direction` representing the swipe direction, implement the next board state.

**Constraints**
- `n = 4` where `n` is the number of rows and columns in `board`
