# Description

Given a list of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order and an integer `k`, return whether any two [elements]{data-definition=element} from the list add up to `k`. You may **not** use the same element twice.

Note: Numbers can be negative or 0.

This should be done in `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` space.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
