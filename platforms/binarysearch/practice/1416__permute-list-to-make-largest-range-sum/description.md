# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` and a two-dimensional list of integers `ranges`. Each element in `ranges` contains `[i, j]`, meaning to sum the numbers in `nums` between `i` to `j` inclusive. 

Given that you can first permute `nums` in any order, return the maximum possible total of all range sums. Return the result mod `10 ** 9 + 7`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `ranges`
