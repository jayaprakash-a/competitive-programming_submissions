# Description

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase alphabet characters, digits, and brackets`"("` and `")"`. `s` encodes a longer string and is represented as concatenation of `n(t)`, where `n` is the number of times `t` is repeated, and `t` is either a regular string or it's another encoded string recursively.

Return the expanded version of `s`. Note that `t` can be the empty string.
