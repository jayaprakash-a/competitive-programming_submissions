# Description

You are given two strings `a` and `b`. Consider taking a non-empty subsequence from `a`, a non-empty subsequence from `b`, and then concatenating the first subsequence with the second.

Return the longest possible palindrome that can be constructed.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `a`
- `1 ≤ m ≤ 1,000` where `m` is the length of `b`
