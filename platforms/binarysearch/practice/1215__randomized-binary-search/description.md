# Description

Consider a modified binary search, where instead of picking the middle element as the pivot, we pick it randomly between the low and the high indices.

Given a list of integers `nums` that's not necessarily sorted, return the number of elements that will always be found using this modified binary search.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
