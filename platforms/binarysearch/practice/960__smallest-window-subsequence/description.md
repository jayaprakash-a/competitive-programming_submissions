# Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the smallest substring in `s` such that `t` is also a [subsequence]{data-definition=subsequence-string} of this substring.

If there's no such substring, return `""`, and if there are multiple smallest substrings, return the leftmost one.

**Constraints**

- `n ≤ 10,000` where `n` is the length of `s`
- `m ≤ 100` where `m` is the length of `t`
