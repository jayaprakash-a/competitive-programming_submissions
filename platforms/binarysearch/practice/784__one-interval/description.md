# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `intervals` where each list represents an inclusive `[start, end]` interval. For an interval `[a, b]` (where `a < b`), its size is defined as `b - a`.

You must add one interval to the given list such that, after merging all the intervals, you get exactly one range left.

Return the minimum possible size of the added interval.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `intervals`.
