# Description

You are given two-dimensional integer matrices `matrix` and `target` with the same number of rows and columns.

Consider an operation where we flip a particular column in `matrix` so that all `1`s become `0`s and all `0`s become `1`s.

Given you can reorder the `matrix` rows for free, return the minimum number of operations required to turn `matrix` into `target`. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 100` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`.
