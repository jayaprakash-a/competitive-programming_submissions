# Description

You are playing a game against a friend where in each round you pick a number from `1` to `k` to add to a shared running total that initially starts from `0`. The first person to reach or exceed the running total to `target` wins.

Given that you go first, return whether you can force a win if everyone plays optimally.

**Constraints**
- `k ≤ 30`
- `target ≤ 1,000`
