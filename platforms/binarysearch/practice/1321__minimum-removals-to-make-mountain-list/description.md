# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums`. Return the minimum number of elements we can remove from `nums` such that the list becomes a mountain list. A mountain list is a list that is first strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing. Each of the increasing and decreasing parts should be non-empty. You can assume that a solution exists.


**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
