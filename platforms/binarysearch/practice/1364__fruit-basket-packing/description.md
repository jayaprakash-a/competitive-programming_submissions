# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `fruits`. Each `fruits[i]` contains `[cost, size, total]`, meaning that fruit `i` costs `cost` each, each one has size of `size`, and there are total of `total` of them. You're also given `k` number of fruit baskets of capacity `capacity`.

You want to fill the fruit baskets with the following constraints in this order:

- Each basket can only contain fruits of the same kind
- Each basket should be as full as possible
- Each basket should be as cheap as possible

Return the minimum cost required to fill as many baskets as possible.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `fruits`
- `0 ≤ k, capacity < 2 ** 31`
