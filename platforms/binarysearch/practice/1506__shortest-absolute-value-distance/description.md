# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix`. You can move up, left, right, down and each move from `matrix[a][b]` to `matrix[c][d]` costs `abs(matrix[a][b] - matrix[c][d])`.

Return the minimum cost to move from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n * m ≤ 200,000` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
