# Description

You are given integers `n` and `k`. Consider a list of numbers from `[1, 2, ..., n]` and generating every permutation of this list in lexicographic order. For example, given `n = 3` we have `["123", "132", "213", "231", "312", "321"]`.

Return the `k`th (0-indexed) value of this permutation sequence as a string.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 10`
