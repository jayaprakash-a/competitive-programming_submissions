# Description

You are given a list of strings `dictionary` and two strings `start` and `end`. You want to reach from `start` to `end` by modifying one character at a time and making sure each resulting word is also in the `dictionary`. Words are case-sensitive.

Return the minimum number of steps it would take to reach `end`. Return `-1` if it's not possible.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n * m ≤ 300,000` where `n` is the length of `dictionary` and `m` is the length of the longest string
