# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `points` where each element contains `[x, y]` representing a cartesian coordinate. We can make an undirected edge between two points `(x0, y0)` and `(x1, y1)`, which costs `abs(x0 - x1) + abs(y0 - y1)`.

Given that we can connect any number of points, return the minimum cost necessary such that every point is connected by a path.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `points`
