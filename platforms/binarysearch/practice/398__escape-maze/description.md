# Description

You are given a two dimensional integer `matrix`, representing a maze where `0` is an empty cell, and `1` is a wall. Given that you start at `matrix[0][0]`, return the minimum number of squares it would take to get to `matrix[R - 1][C - 1]` (where `R` and `C` are the number of rows and columns in the matrix).

If it's not possible, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `n, m ≤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
