# Description

Implement a web browser with the following methods:

- `WebBrowser(String homepage)` constructs a new instance of the browser with starting page of `homepage`.
- `visit(String page)` visits the site `page`, clearing all forward history.
- `back(int n)` goes back `n` number of steps in history and returns the current page. Note that once you reach the `homepage`, you stay on that page even if you go `back`.
- `forward(int n)` goes forward `n` number of steps in history and returns the current page. Note that once you reach the most recent page, you stay on that page even if you go `forward`.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `visit`, `back` and `forward`.
