# Description

You are given two lists of integers `nums0` and `nums1` of the same length as well as integers `dist` and `cost`.

You must start off at index `0` at either `nums0` or `nums1` and want to end up at the last index of either list. In each round, you can choose to switch to the other list for cost of `cost`. And then you can jump forward at most `dist` distance away where the cost of landing at an index is the value at that index.

Return the minimum total cost possible to finish the task.

**Constraints**

- `0 ≤ n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `nums0` and `nums1`.
- `dist ≤ 100`
