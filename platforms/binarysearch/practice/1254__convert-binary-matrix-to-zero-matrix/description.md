# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix` containing `1`s and `0`s. Consider an operation where you take one cell and flip it and all its neighboring (up, down, left, right) cells' values. Return the minimum number of operations required such that matrix contains only `0`s. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 3` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`.
