# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer `matrix` representing a forest where a cell is:

- `0` if it's empty
- `1` if it's a tree
- `2` if it's a tree on fire

Every day, a tree catches fire if there is an adjacent (top, down, left, right) tree that's also on fire. Return the number of days it would take for every tree to be on fire. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n * m ≤ 200,000` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
