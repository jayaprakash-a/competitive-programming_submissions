# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums`. Consider a function `f(i)` which removes the element at index `i` and then returns whether the resulting list's sum of even index values is equal to the sum of odd index values.

Return the number of indexes for which `f` would return true.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
