# Description

You are given an integer `n` and a two-dimensional list of integers `views`. There are `n` teams in a tournament and you want to build two stadiums to host the games. Each element in `views` contains `[a, b, people]` meaning that when team `a` and team `b` compete, there are `people` number of people that will view that game. The viewership numbers among every pair of teams will be in `views`.

You must permanently assign each team to a stadium. Every team in a stadium plays every other team in that stadium, and only within that stadium.

Return the smallest possible maximum capacity of the two stadiums, where the capacity of a stadium is the number of seats required to fit the largest audience of a game in that stadium.

**Constraints**
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 500`
- `1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000` where `m` is the length of `views`
