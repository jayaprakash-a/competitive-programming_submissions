# Description

A Roomba robot is currently sitting in a Cartesian plane at `(0, 0)`. You are given a list of its `moves` that it will make, containing `NORTH`, `SOUTH`, `WEST`, and `EAST`. However, if the Roomba reaches a spot it has been in before, it will continue moving in the same direction until it reaches a spot it has not been in before.

Return whether after its moves it will end up in the coordinate `(x, y)`. 

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `moves`
