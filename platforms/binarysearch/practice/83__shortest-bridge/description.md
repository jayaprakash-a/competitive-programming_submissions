# Description

Given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix` containing `0`s and `1`s, `0` represents water and `1` represents land.

An island is a group of connecting `1`s in 4 directions that are either surrounded by `0`s or by the edges.
Find the shortest bridge that connects two islands.

It is guaranteed that there are two and only two islands.

**Constraints**
- `n, m ≤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
