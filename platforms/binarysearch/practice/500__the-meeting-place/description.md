# Description

You are given a two dimensional integer `matrix` consisting of:

- `0` which represents an empty cell.
- `1` which represents a wall.
- `2` which represents a person.

A person can walk up, down, left and right. Find a non-wall cell such that it minimizes the total travel distance each person has to walk to and return the distance.

Note: two people can walk through a same non-wall cell and you can assume there is some path between any two people.


**Constraints**
- `n, m ≤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
- `k ≤ 20` where `k` is the number of people in `matrix`
