# Description

You are given a binary tree `root`. Return the length of the longest path starting from a node that goes top to bottom where its values form an arithmetic sequence. 

An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between each consecutive two numbers is the same. For example, `[2, 4, 6, 8]` is an arithmetic sequence as is `[1, 4, 7, 10]`. A sequence of length two or fewer is considered an arithmetic sequence.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `root`
