# Description

You are given a list of strings `orders`. Each element in `orders` starts with either `"P"` meaning pickup or `"D"` meaning delivery followed by the order id. For example, `"P12"` means pick up order `12`.

Return whether `orders` is valid given the following rules:

- A delivery cannot happen for an order before pickup
- Every pickup must be delivered
- An order that's already been picked up and delivered cannot be picked up or delivered again

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `orders`
