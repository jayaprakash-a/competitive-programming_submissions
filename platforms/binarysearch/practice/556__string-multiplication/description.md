# Description

Given two strings `a`, and `b`, both representing an integer, multiply them and return it in the same string representation.

Can you implement the multiplication directly, instead of using `eval()` or built-in big integers?

**Constraints**`
- `n ≤ 200` where `n` is the length of `a`
- `m ≤ 200` where `m` is the length of `b`
