# Description

You are given two lists of integers `nums` and `costs` of the same length. Consider an operation where you increment or decrement a `nums[i]` for cost `costs[i]`. Given that you can perform any number of these operations, and you want to make all elements equal in `nums`, return the minimum total cost required. 

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums` and `costs`
