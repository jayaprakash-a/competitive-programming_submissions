# Description

You are given a two dimensional list of integers `matrix` where a `1` represents a communication tower, and `0` represents an empty cell. Towers can communicate in the following ways:

- If tower `a`, and tower `b` are either on the same row or column, they can talk with each other.
- If tower `a` can talk with tower `b` and `b` can talk with `c`, then `a` can talk to `c`.

Return the total number of tower groups there are (a group is a list of towers that can talk with each other).

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 250` where `n` is the number of rows in `matrix`.
- `m ≤ 250` where `m` is the number of columns in `matrix`.
