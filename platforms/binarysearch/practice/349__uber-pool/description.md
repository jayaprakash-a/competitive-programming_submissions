# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer list `requested\_trips` containing `[start\_x, end\_x, num\_passengers]`, and an integer `capacity`. Each requested trip asks to pick up `num\_passengers` passenger at `start\_x` and drop them off at `end\_x`. You also have a car with the given `capacity`, and start at `x = 0`.

Given that you'd like to pick up every passenger and can only move right, return whether you can pick up and drop off everyone.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `requested\_trips`
