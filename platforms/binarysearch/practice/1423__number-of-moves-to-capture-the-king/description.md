# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer matrix `board` containing `0`s, `1`s and `2`s representing some `n x n` chessboard. Each `0` represents an empty cell, `1` represents the [knight]{data-definition=knight} and `2` represents the king. There is at least one knight but exactly one king.


Given that the king stays still, return the minimum number of moves it would take for some knight to land on the king. If there's no solution, return `-1`. A knight can't land on another knight. 

**Constraints**
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 500` where `n` is the number of rows and columns in `board`
- `1 ≤ t < n * n` where `t` is the number of knights
- `k = 1` where `k` is the number of kings.
