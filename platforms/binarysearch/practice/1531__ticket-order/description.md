# Description

You are given a list of positive integers `tickets`. Each `tickets[i]` represents the number of tickets person `i` wants to buy. Tickets are bought in round robin with `i = 0` person buying first. They buy exactly `1` ticket and it takes `1` unit of time to buy the ticket. Afterwards, if they need to buy more tickets, they will go to the end of the queue and wait for their turn.

For each person, return the number of time units it takes to buy all of their tickets.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `tickets`
