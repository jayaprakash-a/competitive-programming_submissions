# Description

You are playing a game and are given integers `n`, `k`, and `h`. Starting at 0 points, you pick a random number between 1 and `h` (inclusive) and gain that many points. You stop once you reach at least `k` points. Return the probability that you have `n` or less points.

Note: Picking numbers is independent and the distribution is uniform, i.e. all outcomes have the same probability.

**Constraints**

- `n, k, h â‰¤ 10,000`
