# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` containing `1`s and `0`s and an integer `k`. Each value in `nums` represents the state of a prison cell where `1` means it's occupied and `0` means it's empty.

On each day if a cell has two adjacent cells that are either both occupied or both empty, then it becomes occupied. Otherwise, it becomes empty.

Return the state of the prison cells after `k` days.

**Constraints**
- `n = 8` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `1 â‰¤ k < 2 ** 31`
