# Description

Given a string of digits `ip`, generate all possible valid IP address combinations and return them in sorted order.

IP addresses must follow the format `A.B.C.D`, where A, B, C, and D are integers between 0 and 255. Zero-prefixed numbers, such as 01 and 065, are not allowed, except for 0 itself.

**Constraints**
- `4 ≤ n ≤ 12` where `n` is the length of `ip`.
