# Description

Consider a complete binary tree of `n` nodes whose values are `1` to `n`. The root has value of `1`, its left child is `2` and its right child is `3`. In general, nodes' values are labelled `1` to `n` in level order traversal.

You are given a binary tree `root` and an integer `target`. Given that the `root` was originally a complete binary tree whose values were labelled as described above, and that some of the subtrees were deleted, return whether `target` exists in `root`.

Bonus: solve in `$\mathcal{O}(h)$` time where `h` is the height of the tree.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `root`
