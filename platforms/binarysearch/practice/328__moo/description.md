# Description

You are given a string `cows` representing the initial conditions of some cows. Each cow can take one of three values:
* `"L"`, meaning the cow is charging to the left.
* `"R"`, meaning the cow is charging to the right.
* `"@"`, meaning the cow is standing still.

Cows charging on a direction will pick up other cows unless the cow receives a force from the opposite direction. Then, it will stand still.

Return the orientation of each cow when the cow stop charging.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `cows`
