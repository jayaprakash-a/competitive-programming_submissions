# Description

Given two integers `r` and `c`, return the number of unique squares that can be made from a grid with `r` rows and `c` columns of evenly-spaced points. Mod the result by `10 ** 9 + 7`.

A square consists of a set of 4 points that form the vertices of a square. Each side of the square must have the same length, and the square does not necessarily have to be aligned with the axes of the grid.

**Constraints**

- `r, c â‰¤ 10,000`
