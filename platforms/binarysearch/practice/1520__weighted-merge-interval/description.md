# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `intervals`. Each element contains `[start, end, weight]`, meaning that during the inclusive integer interval `[start, end]` its weight is `weight`. Weight is additive so if we have `[[1, 5, 6], [2, 7, 3]]`, then during `[2, 5]` we have weight of `9`. The input `intervals` may or may not be overlapping.

Return the list of intervals that have the highest weight, sorted in ascending order. The returned intervals should be merged, so `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` should be merged to `[1, 4]`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `intervals`
- `-2 ** 31 < start ≤ end < 2 ** 31`
