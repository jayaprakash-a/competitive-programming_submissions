# Description

Given a two-dimensional integer `matrix` of `1`s and `0`s, return the number of distinct "islands" in the matrix. A `1` represents land and `0` represents water, so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water. Two islands are distinct if their shapes are different.

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 100` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
