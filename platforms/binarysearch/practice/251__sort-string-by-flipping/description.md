# Description

You are given a string `s` consisting of the letters `"x"` and `"y"`. In addition, you have an operation called `flip`, which changes a single `"x"` to `"y"` or vice versa.

Determine the smallest number of times you would need to apply this operation to ensure that all `"x"`'s come before all `"y"`'s.

**Constraints**

- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s`
