# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer `matrix` containing `0`s and `1`s where `0` represents empty space and `1` represents a wall.

Return the minimum number cells that need to become walls such that there's no path from the top left cell to the bottom right cell. You cannot put walls on the top left cell and the bottom right cell. You are only allowed to travel adjacently (no diagonal moves allowed), and you can't leave the matrix.

**Constraints**
- `2 â‰¤ n, m â‰¤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
