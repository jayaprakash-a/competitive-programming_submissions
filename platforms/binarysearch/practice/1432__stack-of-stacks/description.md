# Description

Implement a data structure with the following methods:

- `StackOfStacks(int capacity)` which instantiates an instance that represents an infinite number of stacks, each with size `capacity`.
- `void push(int val)` which pushes the value `val` to the leftmost stack that's not full.
- `int pop()` which pops the value of the top element of the rightmost non-empty stack. If every stack is empty, return `-1`.
- `int popStack(int idx)` which pops the value of the top element of the `idx` (0-indexed) stack. If the stack at index `idx` is empty, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `push`, `pop` and `popStack`
