# Description

Postfix notation is a way to represent an expression where the operator comes after the operands.

For example, `["2", "2", "+", "6", "*"]` would be equal to 24, since we have `(2 + 2) * 6 = 24`.

Given a list of strings `exp`, representing a postfix notation consisting of integers and operators (`"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, `"/"`), evaluate the expression. `"/"` is integer division.
