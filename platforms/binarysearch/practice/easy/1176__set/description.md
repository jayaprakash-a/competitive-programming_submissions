# Description

Implement a set data structure with the following methods:

- `CustomSet()` constructs a new instance of a set
- `add(int val)` adds `val` to the set
- `exists(int val)` returns whether `val` exists in the set
- `remove(int val)` removes the `val` in the set

This should be implemented without using built-in set.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `add`, `exists` and `remove`
