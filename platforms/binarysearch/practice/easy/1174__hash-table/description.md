# Description

Implement a hash table with the following methods:

- `HashTable()` constructs a new instance of a hash table
- `put(int key, int val)` updates the hash table such that `key` maps to `val`
- `get(int key)` returns the value associated with `key`. If there is no such `key`, then return `-1`.
- `remove(int key)` removes both the `key` and the value associated with it in the hash table.

This should be implemented without using built-in hash table.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `put`, `get` and `remove`
