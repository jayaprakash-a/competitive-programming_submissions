# Description

You are given two lists of integers `rect0` and `rect1` representing coordinates `(x0, y0, x1, y1)` of two rectangles. `(x0, y0)` is the bottom left coordinate and `(x1, y1)` is the upper right coordinate.

Return whether the two rectangles overlap.

Note: if two rectangles touch only in their perimeters, they don't overlap.
