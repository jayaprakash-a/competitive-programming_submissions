# Description

Given two lists of integers `nums`, and `target`, consider an operation where you take some sublist in `nums` and reverse it. Return whether it's possible to turn `nums` into `target`, given you can make any number of operations.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `target`
