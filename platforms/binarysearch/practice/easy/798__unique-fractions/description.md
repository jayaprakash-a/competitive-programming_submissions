# Description

You are given a list of lists `fractions` where each list contains `[numerator, denominator]` which represents the number `numerator / denominator`. 

Return a new list of lists such that the numbers in `fractions` are: 
 - In their most reduced terms. E.g. `8 / 6` becomes `4 / 3`.
 - Any duplicate fractions that represent the same value are removed.
 - Sorted in ascending order by their value.
- If the number is negative, the `-` sign should go to the `numerator` (the input also follows this).

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `fractions`
