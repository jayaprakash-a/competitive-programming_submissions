# Description

You are given a binary string `s` containing `"1"`s and `"0"`s. Consider splitting the string into two non-empty substrings such that `a + b = s`. The score of this split is defined to be the sum of the number of `"0"`s in `a` plus the number of `"1"`s in `b`. Return the maximum score possible.

**Constraints**
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s`
