# Description

Given a [run-length encoded]{data-definition=run-length-encoding} lowercase alphabet string `s`, implement an iterator which is the decoded version of `s`:

- `next()` polls the next element in the iterator
- `hasnext()` which returns whether the next element exists

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `next` and `hasnext`
