# Description

You are given an alphabet (can be lower or uppercase) string `s` and two integers `i` and `j` where `i < j`. Let's say `p` is an infinite string of `s` repeating forever. Return the substring of `p` from indexes `[i, j)`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s
- `0 ≤ i < j < 2 ** 31`
