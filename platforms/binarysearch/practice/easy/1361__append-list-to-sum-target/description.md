# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` and integers `k` and `target`. Consider an operation where we choose an integer `-k ≤ e ≤ k` and append it to `nums`.

Return the minimum number of operations required such that the sum of `nums` equals to `target`.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `1 ≤ k < 2 ** 31`
