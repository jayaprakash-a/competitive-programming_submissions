# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` of length `n` representing the current score of swimmers in a competition. There is one more round to swim and the first place winner for this round gets `n` points, second place `n-1` points, etc. and the last place gets `1` point.

Return the number of swimmers that can still win the competition after the last round. If you tie for first in points, this still counts as winning.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
