# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums`. Return the index of every peak in the list, sorted in ascending order. An index `i` is called a peak if:

- `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]` if `i = 0`
- `nums[i] > nums[i - 1]` if `i = n - 1`
- `nums[i - 1] < nums[i] > nums[i + 1]` otherwise

However, a list of length `1` is not considered a peak.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
