# Description

You are given two strings `typed` and `target`. You want to write `target`, but the keyboard is stuck so some characters may be written `1` or more times. Return whether it's possible that `typed` was meant to write `target`.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `typed`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s`
