# Description

Given a list of integers `nums`, put all the zeros to the back of the list by modifying the list in-place. The relative ordering of other elements should stay the same.

Can you do it in `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` additional space?

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
