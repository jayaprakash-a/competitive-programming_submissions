# Description

Given a binary tree `root`, return the number of unique vertical lines that can be drawn such that every node has a line intersecting it. Each left child is angled at 45 degrees to its left, while the right child is angled at 45 degrees to the right.

For example, `root` and `root.left.right` are on the same vertical line.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `root`
