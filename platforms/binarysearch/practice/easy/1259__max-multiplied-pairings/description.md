# Description

You are given two lists of integers `nums` and `multipliers`. Consider an operation where we remove any number in `nums` and remove any number in `multipliers` then multiply them together. Given that you must repeat this operation until one of the lists is empty, return the maximum sum of the multiplied numbers.

Note that the integers may be negative, zero, and/or positive.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `multipliers`
