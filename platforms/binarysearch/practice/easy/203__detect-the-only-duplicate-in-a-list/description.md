# Description

You are given a list `nums` of length `n + 1` picked from the range `1, 2, ..., n`. By the [pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole\_principle), there must be a duplicate. Find and return it. There is guaranteed to be exactly one duplicate.

Bonus: Can you do this in `$\mathcal{O}(n)$` time and `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` space?

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 10,000`
