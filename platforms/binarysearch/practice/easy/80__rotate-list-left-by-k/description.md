# Description

Write a function that rotates a list of numbers to the left by `k` elements. Numbers should wrap around.

Note: The list is guaranteed to have at least one element, and `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the length of the list.

Bonus: Do this without creating a copy of the list. How many swap or move operations do you need?

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
