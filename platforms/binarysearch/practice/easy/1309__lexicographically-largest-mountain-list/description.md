# Description

You are given three positive integers `n`, `lower`, and `upper`. You want to create a list of length `n` that is strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing and all the numbers are between `[lower, upper]`, inclusive. Each of the increasing and decreasing parts should be non-empty.

Return the [lexicographically]{data-definition=lexicographic-list-list-integer} largest list possible, or the empty list if it's not possible.

**Constraints**
- `3 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`
- `1 ≤ lower ≤ upper < 2 ** 31`
