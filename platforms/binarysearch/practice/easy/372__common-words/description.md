# Description

Given two strings `s0` and `s1`, each representing a sentence, return the number of unique words that are shared between the two sentences.

Note: words are case-insensitive so "hello" and "Hello" are the same word.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s0`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `s1`
