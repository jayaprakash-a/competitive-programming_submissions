# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `intervals` where each element contains the inclusive interval `[start, end]`.

Return the minimum total size of any two non-overlapping intervals, where the size of one interval `[start, end]` is defined to be `end - start + 1`. If there's no such two intervals, return `0`.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `intervals`
