# Description

You are given two lists of integers `a` and `b` where every element in both lists is between `1` to `6`. Consider an operation where you pick a number in either `a` or `b` and update its value to a number between `1` to `6`.

Return the minimum number of operations required such that the sum of `a` and `b` are equal. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `a`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `b`
