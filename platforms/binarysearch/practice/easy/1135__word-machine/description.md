# Description

You are given a list of strings `ops` where each element is either:

- A non-negative integer that should be pushed into a stack
- `"POP"` meaning pop the top element in the stack
- `"DUP"` meaning duplicate the top element in the stack
- `"+"` meaning pop the top two and push the sum
- `"-"` meaning pop the top two and push `top - second`

Return the top element in the stack after applying all operations. If there are any invalid operations, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `ops`
