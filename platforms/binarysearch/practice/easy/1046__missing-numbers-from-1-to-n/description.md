# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` of length `n` where all numbers in the list are from the interval `$[1, n]$` and some elements appear twice while others only once. Return all the numbers from `$[1, n]$` that are not in the list, sorted in ascending order.

Can you do it in `$\mathcal{O}(n)$` time, modify `nums` in-place and use `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` additional space?

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
