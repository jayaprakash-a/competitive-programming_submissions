# Description

Given lowercase alphabet strings `s`, and `t` return whether you can create a 1-to-1 mapping for each letter in `s` to another letter (could be the same letter) such that `s` could be mapped to `t`, with the ordering of characters preserved.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `t`
