# Description

You are given a list of integers `cells`, representing sizes of different cells. In each iteration, the two largest cells `a` and `b` interact according to these rules:

- If `a = b`, they both die.
- Otherwise, the two cells merge and their size becomes `floor((a + b) / 3)`.

Return the size of the last cell or return `-1` if there's no cell is remaining.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `cells`
