# Description

You are given two lists of integers `weights` and `values` which have the same length and an integer `capacity`. `weights[i]` and `values[i]` represent the weight and value of the `i`th item.

Given that you can take at most `capacity` weights, and that you can take a fraction of an item's weight with proportionate value, return the maximum amount of value you can get, rounded down to the nearest integer.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `weights` and `values`
