# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `sticks`. Each element in the list represents a stick with two ends, and has two numbers between `[1, 6]` representing each end. You can connect two sticks together if any of their ends are equal. The resulting stick's ends become the leftover ends and its length is incremented. 

Return the length of the longest stick possible.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 10` where `n` is the length of `sticks`.
