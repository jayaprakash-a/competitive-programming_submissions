# Description

You are given four lists of integers `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and an integer `target`.

Return the number of different unique indices `i, j, k, l` such that `A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] ≤ target`.

**Constraints**
- `a ≤ 1,000` where `a` is the length of `A`
- `b ≤ 1,000` where `b` is the length of `B`
- `c ≤ 1,000` where `c` is the length of `C`
- `d ≤ 1,000` where `d` is the length of `D`
