# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix` containing `1`s and `0`s. In one operation, you can swap two adjacent rows. Return the minimum number of operations needed to make all cells above the top-left to bottom-right diagonal all `0`s. If there's no solution, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 250` where `n` is the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
