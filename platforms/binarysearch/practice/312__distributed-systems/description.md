# Description

A network consists of nodes labeled `0` to `n`. You are given `n` and a list of edges `(a, b, t)` of an undirected graph, describing the time `t` it takes for a message to be sent from node `a` to node `b` (or vice versa). Whenever a node receives a message, it immediately passes the message on to a neighboring node.

Assuming all nodes are connected, determine how long it will take for every node to receive a message that begins at node `0`.
