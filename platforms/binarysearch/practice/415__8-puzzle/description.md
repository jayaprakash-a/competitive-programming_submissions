# Description

You are given a 3x3 `board` of unique integers from 0 to 8, representing the state of a puzzle. In this puzzle, you can swap the `0` with one of its 4 neighbours (if it exists), and you are trying to solve it by obtaining the following configuration:

```
[[0, 1, 2],
 [3, 4, 5],
 [6, 7, 8]]
```

Return the minimum number of swaps required to solve the puzzle, or return `-1` if it's not possible.

**Constraints**
- `n = 3` where `n` is the number of rows and columns in `board`
- `0 ≤ board[r][c] ≤ 8`
