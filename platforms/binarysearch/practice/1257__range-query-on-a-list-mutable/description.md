# Description

Implement a data structure with the following methods:

- `RangeSum(int[] nums)` constructs a new instance with the given `nums`
- `total(int i, int j)` returns the sum of integers from `nums` between `[i, j)`. That is, `nums[i] + nums[i + 1] + ... + nums[j - 1]`
- `update(int idx, int val)` updates `nums[idx]` with value `val`


**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `k ≤ 100,000` where `k` is the number of calls to `total`
