# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix`. Return a new matrix `A` with the same dimensions such that each `A[r][c]` is the rank of `matrix[r][c]`. The ranks of any two elements `a` and `b` that are either on the same row or column are calculated by:

- `rank(a) < rank(b)` if `a < b`
- `rank(a) > rank(b)` if `a > b`
- `rank(a) = rank(b)` if `a = b`

Ranks are greater than or equal to `1` but are as small as possible.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n, m ≤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
