# Description

You are given two lists of integers `nums` and `queries`. You are also given an integer `w`. Return a new list where for each query `q` in `queries`, we answer the question of how many number of different ways are there for a window of length `w` to cover an element with value `q`.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `m â‰¤ n` where `m` is the length of `queries`
- `0 â‰¤ nums[i] < n`
- `0 â‰¤ queries[i] < n`
