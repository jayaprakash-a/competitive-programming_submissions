# Description

Implement a data structure with the following methods:

- `AncestorQuerier(Tree root)` which instantiates the data structure with the given tree node. `root` only contains unique values 
- `int getAncestor(int val, int k)` which returns the `k`th (0-indexed) ancestor of node with value `val`. If there's no `k`th ancestor, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `root`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the number of calls to `getAncestor`
