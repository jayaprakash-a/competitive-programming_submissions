# Description

You are given a list of integers `piles` and an integer `k`. `piles[i]` represents the number of bananas on pile `i`. On each hour, you can choose any pile and eat `r` number of bananas in that pile. If you pick a pile with fewer than `r` bananas, it still takes an hour to eat the pile.

Return the minimum `r` required such that you can eat all the bananas in less than or equal to `k` hours.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `piles`
- `n ≤ k`
