# Description

You are given lists of integers `people`, `jobs`, `profits`. Each person `i` in `people` have `people[i]` amount of strength, and performing job `j` requires `jobs[j]` amount of strength and nets `profits[j]` amount of profit.

Given that each person can perform at most one job, although a job can be assigned to more than one person, return the maximum amount of profit we can attain.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `people`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `jobs` and `profits`
