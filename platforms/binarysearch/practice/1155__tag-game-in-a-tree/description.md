# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `edges` representing a tree, where each element is of the form `[x, y]` meaning there's an undirected edge between `x` and `y`. You are also given integers `u` and `v`.

You are currently at node `u`, and your opponent is at node `v`. In the first round, you move, then in the next round your opponent moves, and then you move, and so on. Your opponent can choose to not make a move in a round. Return the minimum number of rounds it takes for you to catch your opponent, given that you both play optimally.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `edges`
