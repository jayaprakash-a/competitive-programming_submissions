# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix` and integers `row`, `col`, `erow0`, `ecol0`, `erow1`, and `ecol1`. You are currently at `matrix[row][col]` and want to pick up gold that is at `matrix[erow0][ecol0]` and `matrix[erow1][ecol1]`.

You can move up, down, left, and right but when you are at a cell `(r, c)`, you incur cost `matrix[r][c]`, although if you land at a cell more than once, you don't incur that cost again. Return the minimum cost to pick up gold at both locations.

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
