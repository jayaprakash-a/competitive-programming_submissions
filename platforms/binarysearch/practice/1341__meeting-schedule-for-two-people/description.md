# Description

You are given two two-dimensional list of integers `a` and `b` and an integer `duration`. Each element in `a` contains an inclusive interval `[start, end]` meaning that person `a` is free during those times. `b` is in the same format and means `b` is free during those times. Intervals `a` is disjoint as is `b`.

Return the earliest time both people are free for `duration` amount of time. If there's no solution, return the empty list.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `a`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `b`
- `1 ≤ duration`
