# Description

You are playing a game with Lawrence. There are several candies arranged in a line, and you are given a list of integers `nums` representing the point value of each candy.

On each player's turn, they can select `1`, `2`, or `3` candies from the front of the line, remove them, and get the sum of their points added to their score.

The game ends when all the candies are removed and the person with the higher score is the winner.

Assuming you start first and everyone plays optimally, return whether you can win.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
