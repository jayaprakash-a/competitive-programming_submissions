# Description

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Each character in the string is either `'.'` or `'x'`, where `'.'` represents an empty space and `'x'` represents a person.

Return whether it's possible to choose a position to stand on such that the distance between you and the closest person to you is at least `k`. (The distance between each neighbouring indices is `1`).

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s`
