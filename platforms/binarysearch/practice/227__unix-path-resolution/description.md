# Description

Given a Unix `path`, represented as a list of strings, return its resolved version.

In Unix, `".."` means to go to the previous directory and `"."` means to stay on the current directory. By resolving, we mean to evaluate the two symbols so that we get the final directory we're currently in.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `path`
