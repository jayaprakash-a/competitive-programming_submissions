# Description

Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find two non-overlapping sublists in `nums` that each sum up to `k`, and return the sum of their lengths. When there are more than two possible sublists, return the sum of the lengths of the two smallest sublists. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`.
