# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums`. Return a new list of the same length where the value at index `i` is set to the next [element]{data-definition=element} greater than `nums[i]` to its right, circling back to the front of the list if necessary. If there's no number that's greater, then it should be set to `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
