# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `points` and an integer `k`. Each list in `points` is of the form `(x, y)` representing Cartesian coordinates. Assuming you can group any point `a` and `b` if the Euclidean distance between them is `≤ k`, return the total number of disjoint groups.

Note that if points `a` and `b` are grouped and `b` and `c` are grouped, then `a` and `c` are in the same group.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is length of `points`.
