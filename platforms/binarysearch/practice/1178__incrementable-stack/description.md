# Description

Implement a stack with the following methods:

- `IncrementableStack()` constructs a new instance of an incrementable stack
- `append(int val)` appends `val` to the stack
- `pop()` pops and returns the last element in the stack
- `increment(int inc, inc count)` increments the value of bottom `count` elements by `inc`

Each method should be done in `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` time. You can assume that for `pop`, the stack is non-empty when it is called.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `append`, `pop, and `increment`.
