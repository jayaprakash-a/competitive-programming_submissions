# Description

Sudoku is a puzzle where you're given a partially-filled 9 by 9 grid with digits. The objective is to fill the grid with the constraint that every row, column, and box (3 by 3 subgrid) must contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Implement an efficient sudoku solver that takes in an incomplete board and solves it. In the given board, the incomplete spaces will be 0.

**Constraints**
- `n = 9` where `n` is the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
