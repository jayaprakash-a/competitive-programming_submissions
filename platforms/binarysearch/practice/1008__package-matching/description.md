# Description

You are given two-dimensional list of integers `sales` and `buyers`. Each element in `sales` contains `[day, price]` meaning that the package is only available for sale on that day for that price. Each element in `buyers` contains `[payday, amount]` meaning that the buyer has that amount of money to spend on `payday` and afterwards.

Given that each buyer can buy at most one package, and each package can be sold to at most one person, return the maximum number of packages that can be bought.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `buyers`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `sales`
