# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `edges` which represents a directed, weighted graph. Each element in `edges` contains `[u, v, w]` meaning that there is an edge from node `u` to node `v` which costs positive weight `w`. You are also given integers `start` and `end`.

Return the cost of the shortest path from `start` to `end`. If there is no path between the two nodes, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `edges`
