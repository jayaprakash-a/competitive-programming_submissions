# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` containing `0`s and `1`s and you are playing a game against a friend. In each turn, a player must toggle a sublist equal to `[1, 1]` into `0`s. The player who can't toggle loses.

Assuming you play first and play optimally, return whether you can win the game.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 50` where `n` is the length of `nums`.
