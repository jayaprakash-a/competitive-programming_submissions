# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer `matrix` where each cell represents number of coins in that cell. You have two people that can collect coins for you, initially placed at the top left corner and at the top right corner.

Given the following rules:

- From a cell `(i, j)`, a person can move to cell `(i + 1, j - 1)`, `(i + 1, j)`, or `(i + 1, j + 1)`
- When a person moves to a cell, it collects all the coins on that cell and the cell becomes empty.
- A person may stay on the same cell, but the coins on that cell are only collected once.

Return the maximum number of coins that can be collected by both people.

**Constraints**

- `n, m â‰¤ 100` where n and m are the number of rows and columns
