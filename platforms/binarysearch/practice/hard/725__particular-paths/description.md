# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer `matrix` and an integer `k`. Each cell in the matrix has either a `0` or a `1`. You start at the top-left square, and you must get to the bottom right square. In one step, you can only go down, or right.

The score of a path is the sum of the values on the cells on the path. Return the number of paths from the top left square to the bottom right square, with score `k`.

Return the answer modulo `10^9+7`.

**Constraints**
- `h, w ≤ 100` where `h` and `w` are the height and width of `matrix`.
- `k ≤ 100,000`
