# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `boxes`. Each list contains two integers `[width, height]` which represent the width and height of a box. Given that you can put a box in another box if both of its width and height are smaller than the other box, return the maximum number of boxes you can fit into a box.

You cannot rotate the boxes.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `boxes`
