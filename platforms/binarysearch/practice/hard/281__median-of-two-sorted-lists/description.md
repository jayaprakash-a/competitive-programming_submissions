# Description

Given a sorted list of integers `nums0`, and another sorted list `nums1`, find the median of the list that's obtained if `nums0` and `nums1` were merged.

Median of a list of size `n` is defined to be `list[floor(n / 2)]`.

Time complexity should be `$\mathcal{O}(\log{}(n+m))$`.


**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums0`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `nums1`
