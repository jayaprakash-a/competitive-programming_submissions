# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix`. You want to pick a number from each row. For each `0 ≤ r < n - 1` the cost for picking `matrix[r][j]` and `matrix[r + 1][k]` is `abs(k - j)`.

Return the maximum sum possible of the numbers chosen, minus costs.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n * m ≤ 200,000` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
