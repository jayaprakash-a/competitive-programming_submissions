# Description

A person is placed on a list of length `length`, at index `0`, and on each step, they can move right one index or left one index (without going out of bounds), or stay on that index.

Given that the person can take exactly `n` steps, how many unique walks can the person take and reach back to index `0`? Mod the result by `10 ** 9 + 7`.

**Constraints**

- `length ≤ 1,000`
- `n ≤ 500`
