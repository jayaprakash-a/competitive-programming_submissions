# Description

Given a list of integers `nums`, we say that two numbers `nums[i] ≤ nums[j]` are adjacent if there's no number in between `(nums[i], nums[j])` in `nums`.

Return the minimum possible `abs(j - i)` such that `nums[j]` and `nums[i]` are adjacent.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
