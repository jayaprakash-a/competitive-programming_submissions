# Description

You are given a list of sorted integers `stones` representing the positions of stones on a river you are trying to cross. To cross the river, you must end up on the last stone.

At every step, you can jump `k - 1`, `k`, or `k + 1` units ahead where `k` is the distance of your last jump.

Assuming you start on the first stone and your first jump must have a distance of `1`, return whether you can cross the river.

**Constraints**

- `2 ≤ n ≤ 1,000` where n is the length of `stones`.
