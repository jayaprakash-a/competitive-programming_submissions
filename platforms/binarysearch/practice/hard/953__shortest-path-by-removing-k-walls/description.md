# Description

You are given a two-dimensional `matrix` of `1`s and `0`s, where `0` represents an empty space while `1` represents a wall you cannot walk through. You are also given an integer `k`.

You can walk up, down, left, or right. Given that you can remove up to `k` walls, return the minimum number of steps to walk from the top left corner `(0, 0)` to the bottom right corner (n - 1, m - 1).

If there is no way to walk from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, return -1.

**Constraints**

- `n, m â‰¤ 50` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
