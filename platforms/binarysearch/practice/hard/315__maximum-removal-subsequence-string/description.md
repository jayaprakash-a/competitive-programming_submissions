# Description

You are given two lowercase alphabet strings `s` and `t` where `t` is a [subsequence]{data-definition=subsequence-string} of `s`.

Return the maximum length of a substring that you can remove from `s` such that after the removal, `t` is still a subsequence of `s`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `t` and `m` is the length of `s`
