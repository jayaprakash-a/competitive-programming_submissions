# Description

On a mysterious island there are creatures known as Quxes which come in three colors: red, green, and blue. One power of the Qux is that if two differently-colored Quxes are standing next to each other, they can transform into a single creature of the third color.

Given a list of strings `quxes` representing Quxes standing in a line, determine the smallest number of them remaining after any possible sequence of such transformations.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `quxes`
