# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `mines` and an integer `width`. Each element in `mines` contains `[x, y, r]` meaning there is a mine located at [coordinate]{data-definition=cartesian} `(x, y)` which activates at any radius less than or equal to `r`. There can be at most one mine in each location.

Consider an infinitely tall rectangle between `x = 0` and `x = width`. Within this rectangle, return whether you can draw a continuous path that starts from below all the mines and ends above every mine, without activating one. You can assume that every mine is contained in this rectangle. 

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `mines`
- `0 ≤ width`
