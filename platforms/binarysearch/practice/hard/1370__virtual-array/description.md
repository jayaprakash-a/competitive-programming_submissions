# Description

Implement a virtual array which implements the following methods:

- `void set(int start, int end)` which sets the values in the array from `[start, end]` inclusive to `true`.
- `boolean get(int idx)` which returns `true` if it is set, otherwise `false`.

Bonus: solve using `$\mathcal{O}(k)$` space total where `k` is the number of disjoint intervals.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ start ≤ end < 2 ** 31`
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `set` and `get`
