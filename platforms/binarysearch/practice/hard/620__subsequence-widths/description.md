# Description

Given a list of integers `nums`, let's define the width of a sequence of numbers as the difference between the largest and smallest number in the sequence. Return the sum of widths of all [subsequences]{data-definition=subsequence-list-integer} of `nums` and mod the result by `10 ** 9 + 7`.


**Constraints**

- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10,000`
