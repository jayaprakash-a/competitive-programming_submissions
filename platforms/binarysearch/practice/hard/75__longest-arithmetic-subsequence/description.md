# Description

Given a list of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest arithmetic [subsequence]{data-definition=subsequence-list-integer}.

A sequence `B[i]` is defined as an arithmetic sequence if `B[i+1] - B[i]` have the same value for every `0 ≤ i < len(B) - 1`.
For example, `[1, 5, 9, 13, 17]` is the longest arithmetic subsequence of `[-30, 1, 10, 5, 9, -20, 13, 17]`.

**Constraints**

- `n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
