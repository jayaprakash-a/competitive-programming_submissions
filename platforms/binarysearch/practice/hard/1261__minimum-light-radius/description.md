# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` representing coordinates of houses on a 1-dimensional line. You have `3` street lights that you can put anywhere on the coordinate line and a light at coordinate `x` lights up houses in `[x - r, x + r]`, inclusive. Return the smallest `r` required such that we can place the `3` lights and all the houses are lit up. 

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
