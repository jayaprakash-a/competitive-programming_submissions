# Description

Given a list of integers `nums`, and an integer `k`, return whether it's possible to split the list into lists such that each list has a length `≥ k` and is strictly increasing. The list does not need to be split contiguously, that is, you can take integers from `nums` and place them in any list in any order.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`.
