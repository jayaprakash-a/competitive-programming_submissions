# Description

You are given a list of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`. Consider an operation where you merge exactly `k` consecutive numbers, which costs the sum of those numbers.

Given that you can make any number of operations, return the minimum cost necessary to merge all the numbers into one number. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 40` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `2 ≤ k ≤ 40`
- `nums[i] ≤ 100`
