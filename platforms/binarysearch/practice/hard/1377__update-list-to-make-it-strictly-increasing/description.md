# Description

You are given two lists of integers `a` and `b`. In one operation, you can set `a[i] = b[j]` for any `i` and `j`. Return the minimum number of operations required to make `a` strictly increasing. If it's not possible, return `-1`.


**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `a`
- `1 ≤ m ≤ 1,000` where `m` is the length of `b`
