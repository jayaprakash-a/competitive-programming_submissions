# Description

You are looking to paint a row of N fences that can be of K different colors. You have a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring fences are of the same color.

Given an N by K matrix where the `n`th row and `k`th column represents the cost to paint the `n`th fence with `k`th color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.

Note: All costs will be integers greater than or equal to `0`, and there is guaranteed to be at least 2 possible colors.

Bonus: solve in `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` space.

**Constraints**

- `N, K â‰¤ 500`
