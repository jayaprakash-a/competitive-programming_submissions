# Description

Given a string `s` representing an arithmetic s-expression, evaluate and return it as an integer.

An s-expression is an expression that's either an integer, like `5`, or a recursive expression wrapped in parentheses like `(+ (- 2 1) (* 2 2))`, which is equivalent to `(2 - 1) + (2 * 2) = 5`. Valid operations are `+`, `-`, `/`, and `*`.

Note: `/` is integer division.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `s`
