You are given a string `s` and an integer `target`. `s` represents a decimal number containing digits from `0` to `9`. You can partition `s` into as many parts as you want and take the sum of its parts. Afterwards, return the minimum possible absolute difference to `target`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n, target ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `s`
