# Description

You are given a non-negative `num`. In one operation, you can perform one of two moves:

- Set the rightmost bit to either `0` or `1`
- Set an `i`th bit if `(i - 1)`st bit is `1` and `(i - 2)`nd to `0`th bits are all set to `0`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to turn `num` into `0`.

**Constraints**
- `0 â‰¤ n < 2 ** 31`
