# Description

You are given two two-dimensional list of integers `edges` and `queries`. 

`edges` represents an undirected graph and each element is in the form `[x, y, w]` meaning that vertices `x` and `y` are connected with edge weight `w`.

`queries` is also in the form `[x, y, w]` and represents the question of does there exist a path between `x` and `y` such that each edge in it have weight of at most `w`.

Return the number of queries that are true.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `edges`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `queries`
