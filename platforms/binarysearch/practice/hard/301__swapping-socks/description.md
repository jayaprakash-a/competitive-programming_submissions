# Description

You are given a list of integers `row` representing socks lying in a row. They are currently randomly ordered, but we would like to rearrange them so that each pair of socks are side by side. Socks pairs are `(0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5), ...`.

Return the minimum number of swaps necessary for this to happen.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `row`
