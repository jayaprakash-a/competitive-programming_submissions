# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `connections`. Each element contains `[f, t, id]` meaning that bus `id` has a route from location `f` to location `t`. It costs one unit of money to get on a new bus, but if you stay on the same bus continuously, you only pay one unit. Return the minimum cost necessary to take the bus from location `0` to the largest location. Return `-1` if it's not possible.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the number of bus stops
- `m ≤ 1,000` where `m` is the number of bus ids
- `c ≤ 100,000` where `c` is the length of `connections`
