# Description

Given a positive integer `k`, consider the smallest positive integer `x` which all integers from `1`..`k` inclusive divide evenly. That is, consider the smallest `x` where `x % 1 == 0`, `x % 2 == 0`, ..., `x % k == 0`.

Return the number of trailing zeroes in `x`.

**Constraints**

- `1 ≤ k ≤ 1,000,000,000`
