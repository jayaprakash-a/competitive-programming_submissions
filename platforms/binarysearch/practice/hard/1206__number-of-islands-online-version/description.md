# Description

You want to add blocks of land to an infinite grid of water one by one. You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `land\_requests` where each element is in the form `[r, c]` representing the coordinates of each block of land you will add. Return a new list of the same length where each element contains the number of islands that exist after adding each block of land in `land\_requests`.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `land\_requests`
- `0 ≤ r, c` for any `[r, c]` in `land\_requests`
