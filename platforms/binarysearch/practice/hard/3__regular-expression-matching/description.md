# Description

Implement regular expression matching with the following special characters:

- `.` (period) which matches any single character
- `*` (asterisk) which matches zero or more of the preceding element

That is, implement a function that takes in a valid regular expression `pattern` and a string `s` and returns whether or not the string matches the regular expression.

Note: The input pattern is guaranteed not to have consecutive asterisks.

**Constraints**

- `n ≤ 100` where `n` is the length of `pattern`
- `m ≤ 1,000` where `m` is the length of `s`
