# Description

You are driving a car in a one-dimensional line and are currently at `position = 0` with `speed = 1`. You can make one of two moves:

- Accelerate: `position += speed` and `speed *= 2`
- Reverse: `speed = -1` if `speed > 0` otherwise `speed = 1`.

Return the minimum number of moves it would take to reach `target`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ target ≤ 100,000`
