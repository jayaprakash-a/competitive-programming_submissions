# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums`. Return the number of [permutations]{data-definition=permutation-list-integer} of `nums` such that every pair of adjacent numbers' sum is a perfect square. Two permutations `A` and `B` are different if there's some index `i` where `A[i] ≠ B[i]`.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 12` where `n` is the length of `nums`
