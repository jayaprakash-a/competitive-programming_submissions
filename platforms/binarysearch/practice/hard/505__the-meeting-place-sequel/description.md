# Description

You are given a two dimensional integer `matrix` consisting of:

- `0` which represents an empty cell.
- `1` which represents a wall.
- `2` which represents a person.

A person can walk up, down, left, right or stay in one time unit. Find a walkable cell such that it minimizes the time it would take for everyone to meet and return the time.

Note: two people can walk through the same empty cell and you can assume there is always some path between any two people.

**Constraints**

- The number of cells in the `matrix` is at most `100,000`
- Any two people are at most `30` travel distance away
- There are at most `30` people in the `matrix`
