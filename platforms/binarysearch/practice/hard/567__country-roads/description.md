# Description

A country can be represented as a tree with `n` nodes and `n - 1` edges. Each node represents a town, and each edge represents a piece of road.

You’re given two lists of integers of size `n - 1`, `source` and `dest`. The `i`-th road connects town `source[i]` to town `dest[i]`. The roads are bidirectional.

You’re also given a list of integers `population` of size `n`, where `population[i]` represents the population of the `i`-th town.

You are looking to upgrade some number of towns into cities.

However, there is a catch: no two cities should be adjacent to each other due to fierce competition, and every node adjacent to a town should be a city to allow easier access to infrastructure. In other words, every road must connect a town and a city.

What is the maximum possible population of all the cities?

**Constraints**

- `n ≤ 10,000`
