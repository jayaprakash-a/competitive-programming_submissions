# Description

Given a list of `words` and an integer line length `k`, return a list of strings which represents each line fully justified, with as many words as possible in each line.

There should be at least one space between each word, and pad extra spaces when necessary so that each line has exactly length `k`. Spaces should be distributed as equally as possible, with any extra spaces distributed starting from the left.

If you can only fit one word on a line, then pad the right-hand side with spaces.

Each word is guaranteed not to be longer than `k`.
