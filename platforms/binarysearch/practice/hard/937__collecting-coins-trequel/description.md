# Description

You are given a two-dimensional `matrix` where each cell is one of `3` possible values:

- `0` represents an empty space you can walk through.
- `1` represents a coin you can pick up.
- `-1` represents a wall you cannot walk through.

Return the maximum number of coins you can pick up by:

- Starting at the top left `(0, 0)` and reaching the bottom right only moving right or down
- Then returning to the top left `(0, 0)` by only moving up or left

When you pick up a coin, the cell becomes an empty space. If you can't reach the bottom right corner, return 0.

**Constraints**

- `n, m â‰¤ 75` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
