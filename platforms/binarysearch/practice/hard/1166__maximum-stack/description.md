# Description

Implement a maximum stack with the following methods:

- `MaximumStack()` constructs a new instance of a maximum stack
- `append(int val)` appends `val` to the stack
- `peek()` retrieves the last element in the stack
- `max()` retrieves the maximum value in the stack
- `pop()` pops and returns the last element in the stack
- `popmax()` pops and returns the last occurrence of the maximum value in the stack

You can assume that for `peek`, `max`, `pop` and `popmax`, the stack is non-empty when they are called.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of methods that will be called.
