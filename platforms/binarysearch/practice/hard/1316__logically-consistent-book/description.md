# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `lists`. Each element contains `[start, end, type]`, meaning that from pages `[start, end]` inclusive, there's either an even number of words (`type = 0`) or an odd number of words (`type = 1`).

Return whether `lists` is logically consistent.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `lists`
