# Description

You are given a list of unique integers `nums`. We can create a binary search tree by taking each number in order and inserting it to an initially null binary search tree. Return the number of permutations of `nums` from which we can generate the same binary search tree. Mod the result by `10 ** 9 + 7`.

You can assume that the binary search tree does no rebalancing.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
