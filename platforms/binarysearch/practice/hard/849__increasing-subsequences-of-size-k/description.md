# Description

Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of [subsequences]{data-definition=subsequence-list-integer} of size `k` that are strictly increasing.

Mod the result by `10 ** 9 + 7`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- `1 ≤ k ≤ 10`
