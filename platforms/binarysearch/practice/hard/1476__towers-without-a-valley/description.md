# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums`. Consider a list of integers `A` such that `A[i] ≤ nums[i]`. Also, there are no `j` and `k` such that there exist `j < i < k` and `A[j] > A[i]` and `A[i] < A[k]`.

Return the maximum possible sum of `A`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
