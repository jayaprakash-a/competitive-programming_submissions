# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix` where `matrix[r][c]` represents the number of coins in that cell. 

You can start from any position and want to collect coins by moving up, down, left and right. When you move to a cell the coins are collected and the cell's value is set to `0`. 

Given that you can't visit a cell with `0` coins, return the maximum amount of coins you can collect.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 20` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
- `0 ≤ matrix[r][c] ≤ 100`
- `Number of cells where there's a coin is ≤ 30`
