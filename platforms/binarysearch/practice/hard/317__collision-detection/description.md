# Description

Given a list of points `[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xn, yn]]`, representing a polygon, and `x` and `y`, determine if `(x, y)` lies inside this polygon or on the boundary.

You can assume these points are given in order; that is, you can construct the polygon by connecting point 1 to point 2, point 2 to point 3, and so on, finally looping around to connect point N to point 1.
