# Description

You are given a list of positive integers `nums` where at each index `i` you can either jump to index `i + nums[i]` or to `i - nums[i]` if it is within the list.

For each number in the list, find the minimum number of jumps required to reach another value with different parity in the original order of the input. If you cannot reach another number with different parity, set it to `-1`.

**Constraints**

- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
