# Description

You are given two-dimensional list of integers `producers` and `consumers`. Each element in `producers` contains `[start, end, watts]` meaning that during the inclusive, integer interval `[start, end]` this producer produces `watts` of power. Similarly, each element in `consumers` contains `[start, end, watts]` meaning that during the inclusive, integer interval `[start, end]` this consumer will consume `watts` of power. 

Return whether all consumers will be able to consume the requested amount of power during their intervals.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `producers`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `consumers`
- `0 ≤ start ≤ end < 2 ** 31`
