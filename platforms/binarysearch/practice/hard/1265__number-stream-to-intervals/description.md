# Description

Implement a data structure with the following methods:

- `StreamSummary()` constructs a new instance.
- `add(int val)` adds the number `val` to the instance. 
- `int[][] get()` returns a sorted list of disjoint intervals summarizing the numbers we've seen so far.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 10,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `add`
- `m ≤ 10,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `get`
