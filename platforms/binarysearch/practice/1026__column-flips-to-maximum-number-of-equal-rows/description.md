# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer matrix `matrix` containing `1`s and `0`s. Consider an operation where you flip a column such that all `1`s become `0`s and all `0`s become `1`s.

Given you can perform this operation as many times you want, return the maximum number of rows that have either all `1`s or all `0`s.

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 250` where `n`, `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
