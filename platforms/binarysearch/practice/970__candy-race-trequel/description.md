# Description

You are given a list of integers `candies` representing candies arranged in a line where each element is its point value.

You can take any candy at index `i` and you will get `candies[i - 1] * candies[i] * candies[i + 1]` candies. After taking the candy, the candy on the left and the right become adjacent to each other. The boundaries have a point value of `1`.

Return the maximum number of points you can get.

**Constraints**

- `n ≤ 200` where n is the length of `candies`
- `0 ≤ candies[i] ≤ 100`
