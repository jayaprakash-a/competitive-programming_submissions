# Description

You are given four integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and `k`. `n` represents an `n` by `n` chessboard and `x`, `y` represents a [knight]{data-definition=knight} positioned at `(x, y)`. The knight has to take exactly `k` steps, where at each step it chooses any of the `8` directions uniformly at random. 

Return the percentage chance rounded down to the nearest integer that the knight remains in the chessboard after taking `k` steps, with the condition that it can’t enter the board again once it leaves it.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 25`
- `0 ≤ k ≤ 100`
