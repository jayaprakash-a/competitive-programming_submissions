# Description

You are given an integer `k` and a binary search tree `root`, where each node is either a [leaf]{data-definition=leaf} or contains 2 children.

Find the node containing the value `k`, and return its sibling's value.

You can assume that the solution always exists (e.x. root won't have value of `k`)

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `root`
