# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. The `nums` list represents the costs of landing at each index. You must start at index `0` and end at the last index of `nums`. In each step you can move from some position `X` to any position up to `k` steps away. 

You want to minimize the sum of the costs of the positions you land at. What is this minimum sum?

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `1 ≤ k ≤ 100,000`
