# Description

You are given two-dimensional lists of integers `roads` and `countries` as well as integers `start` and `end`. Each element in `roads` contains `[x, y, weight]` meaning that to travel from city `x` to `y` costs `weight`. Each element `countries[i]` represents all of the cities that belong to country `i`. Every city belongs to exactly one country.

You are currently in city `start` and want to travel to city `end`. During this trip, you want to minimize country-to-country border hops as a first priority, and then minimize total weight. Return a list of two elements where the first is the number of country-to-country hops and the second element is the total weight needed to make this trip. You can assume there is a solution.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `roads`
