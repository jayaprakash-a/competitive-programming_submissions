# Description

You are given two lists of integers `costs\_from` and `costs\_to` of the same length where each index `i` represents a city. Building a one-way road from city `i` to `j` costs `costs\_from[i] + costs\_to[j]`. You are also given a two-dimensional list of integers `edges` where each list contains `[x, y]` meaning there's already a one-way road from city `x` to `y`.

Given that we want to be able to go to any city from city `0` (not necessarily in one path), return the minimum cost to build the necessary roads.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `costs\_from` and `costs\_to`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `edges`
