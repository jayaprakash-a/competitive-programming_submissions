# Description

Implement an iterator where, given a sorted lowercase alphabet string `s` of unique characters and an integer `k`:

- `next()` polls the next [lexicographically]{data-definition=lexicographic-list-string} smallest [subsequence]{data-definition=subsequence-string} of length `k`
- `hasnext()` which returns whether the next subsequence exists

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `next` and `hasnext`
