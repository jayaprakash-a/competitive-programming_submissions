# Description

You are given two lists of integers `nums` and `multipliers`. 

For each `i = 0` to `i = multiplers.length - 1`, inclusive, perform the following operation:

- Remove one integer `e` from either the beginning or the end of `nums`
- Add `multipliers[i] * e` to your running total

Return the maximum total possible after performing the operations.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `nums` and `m` is the length of `multipliers`
