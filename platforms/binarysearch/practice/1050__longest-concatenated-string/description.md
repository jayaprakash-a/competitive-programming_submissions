# Description

You are given a list of strings `words` where each string consists of lowercase alphabet characters. Strings can be concatenated if they follow both of these two rules:

- `x + y` can be formed if the first character of `y` is equal to the last character of `x`
- `x + y` can be formed if `x` comes before `y`

Return the longest resulting string possible such that the first character and the last character is the same.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `words`
