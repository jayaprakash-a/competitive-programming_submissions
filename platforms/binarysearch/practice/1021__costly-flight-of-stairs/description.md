# Description

You are given a list of integers `stairs` and an integer `k`. You are currently at stair `0` and want to climb to the last index of `stairs`. The cost of using stair `i` is `stairs[i]` and in each round you can either jump `1`, `2`, ... `k`, stairs at once.

Return the minimum cost to climb to the last stair.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
