# Description

You are given a list of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`. Return the length of the shortest sublist (can be empty sublist ) you can delete such that the resulting list's sum is divisible by `k`. You cannot delete the entire list. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
