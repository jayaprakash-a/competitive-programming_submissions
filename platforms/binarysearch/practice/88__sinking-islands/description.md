# Description

Given an 2D `matrix` of `0`s and `1`s, a `1` represents land and `0` represents water. An island is a group of `1`'s that are surrounded by `0`s or by the border. Find all the islands that are completely surrounded by water and modify them into `0`s.

An island is completed surrounded by water if all of the neighbours are water (that is, none of the neighbours are borders).

Note: Neighbours can only be directly horizontal or vertical, not diagonal.

**Constraints**

- `n, m â‰¤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
