# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` and a two-dimensional list of integers `operations`. Each operation is of the following form: `[L, R, X]`, which means that you should increment by `X` all the elements from indices `L` to `R` inclusive in the list (the list is 0-indexed).

Apply all operations and return the final list.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 10,000` where `n` is length of `nums`
- `o ≤ 10,000` where `o` is length of `operations`
