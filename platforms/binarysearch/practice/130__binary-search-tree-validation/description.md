# Description

Given a binary tree `root`, return whether it's a binary search tree. A binary tree `node` is a binary search tree if :

- All nodes on its left subtree are smaller than `node.val`
- All nodes on its right subtree are bigger than `node.val`
- All nodes hold the these properties.

**Constraint**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `root`
