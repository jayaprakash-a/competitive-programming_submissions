# Description

You are given two integer lists `a` and `b` where each list represents a vector in run-length encoded form. For example, a vector `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` is represented as `[4, 1, 5, 2]`. (There are `4` ones and `5` twos.)

Return the dot product of the two vectors `a` and `b`. 

The dot product of a vector `[x1, x2, ..., xn]` and `[y1, y2, ..., yn]` is defined to be `x1 * y1 + x2 * y2 + ... + xn * yn`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000` where `n` is the length of `a`
- `1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000` where `m` is the length of `b`
