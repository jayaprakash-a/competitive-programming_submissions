# Description

You are given two lowercase alphabet strings `s` and `t`. Return the number of pairs of substrings across `s` and `t` such that if we replace a single character to a different character, it becomes a substring of `t`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100` where `n` is the length of `s`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100` where `m` is the length of `t`
