# Description


You are given a list of list of integers `intervals` of the form `[start, end]` representing the starts and end points of banners you want to hang. Each banner needs at least one pin to stay up, and one pin can hang multiple banners. Return the smallest number of pins required to hang all the banners.

Note: The endpoints are inclusive, so if two banners are touching, e.g. `[1, 3]` and `[3, 5]`, you can put a pin at `3` to hang both of them.

**Constraints**

- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `intervals`
