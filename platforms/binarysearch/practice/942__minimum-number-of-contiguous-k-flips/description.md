# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` containing `1`s and `0`s and an integer `k`. Consider an operation where we flip a sublist of length `k` such that all `1`s become `0`s and all `0`s become `1`s.

Return the minimum number of operations required to turn `nums` into all `0`s. If it's not possible return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `k ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`.
