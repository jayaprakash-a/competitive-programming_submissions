# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums`. Consider a tree where `nums` represents the values of its [leaves]{data-definition=leaf} in an inorder traversal. Internal nodes have `2` children and their value is equal to the product of the largest leaf value of its left subtree and the largest leaf value of its right subtree.

Find the tree with the minimum sum of its values and return the sum.

For example, given `[2, 3, 5]`, the minimum sum tree is 

```
 15
 / \
 6 5
 / \
2 3 
```


**Constraints**
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 50` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 20`
