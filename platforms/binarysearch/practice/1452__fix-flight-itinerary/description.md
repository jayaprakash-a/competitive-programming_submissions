# Description

You are given a list of uppercase alphabet strings `itinerary` and a two-dimensional list of uppercase alphabet strings `edges`. `itinerary` contains the list of airports you visited in order but the airport names may be misspelled. Each element in `edges` contains `[source, dest]` meaning there is a flight that goes from `source` to `dest`. Every airport has the same length of `3`.

Return the minimum number of characters you can change in `itinerary` such that the itinerary becomes valid. You can assume that there is a solution.

**Constraints**
- `n * m ≤ 200,000` where `n` is the length of `itinerary`, `m` is the length of `edges`
