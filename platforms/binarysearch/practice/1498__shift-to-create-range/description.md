# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` of length `n`. Return whether you can make a list `[1, 2, ..., n]` or `[n, n - 1, ..., 1]` by shifting `nums` to the right any number of times.

For example, shifting `[1, 2, 4, 3]` right once gives us `[3, 1, 2, 4]`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
