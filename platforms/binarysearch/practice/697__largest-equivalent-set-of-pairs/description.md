# Description

Given a list of integers `nums`, find two sets such that their sums are equal and is maximized, and return one of the sets' sums.

Note that not all integers in `nums` need to be used and the two sets may be empty. A number cannot be in both of the two sets.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 30` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100`
