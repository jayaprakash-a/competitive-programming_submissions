# Description

You are given two lists of integers `cores` and `tasks`. Each `cores[i]` represents the number of cores available in server `i`. And each `tasks[i]` represents the number of cores needed to run that task.

Each task can be run in only one server but each server can run multiple tasks. Return whether it's possible to run all the tasks with the given cores.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 15` where `n` is the length of `cores`
- `m ≤ 15` where `m` is the length of `tasks`
