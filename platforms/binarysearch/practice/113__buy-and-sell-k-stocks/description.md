# Description

Given a list of integers `nums` representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order and an integer `k`, return the maximum profit you can make from up to `k` buys and sells. You must buy the stock before you can sell it, and you must sell the stock before you can buy it again.

Note: You are not required to make `k` trades; you can make anywhere between 0 to `k` trades.

**Constraints**

- `n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `k ≤ 100`
