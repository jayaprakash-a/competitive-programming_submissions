# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `edges`, a list of floats `success`, and integers `start` and `end`. `edges` represents an undirected, weighted graph. Each `edges[i]` contains `[u, v]` meaning `u` and `v` is connected, and the chance of successfully traversing the edge is `success[i]` chance.

Given that you start at node `start` and you want to arrive at node `end`, return the highest overall chance you can get by taking any path. If there's no path to `end`, return `0`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `edges` and `success`
- `0 ≤ success[i] ≤ 1`
