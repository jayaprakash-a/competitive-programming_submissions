# Description

Implement a stack with the following methods:

- `MinimumStack()` constructs a new instance of a minimum stack
- `append(int val)` appends `val` to the stack
- `peek()` retrieves the last element in the stack
- `min()` retrieves the minimum value in the stack
- `pop()` pops and returns the last element in the stack

Each method should be done in `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` time. You can assume that for `peek`, `min` and `pop`, the stack is non-empty when they are called.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `append`, `peek`, `min`, and `pop`.
