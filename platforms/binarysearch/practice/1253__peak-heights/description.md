# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer `matrix` containing `0`s and `1`s where `0` represents water and `1` represents land. Return a new matrix of the same dimensions where we increase the height of every land cell as much as possible given that:

- The height of any water cell stays `0`
- Any cell can differ by at most `1` unit of height between neighboring cells (up, down, left, right)

You can assume there is at least one water cell.

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
