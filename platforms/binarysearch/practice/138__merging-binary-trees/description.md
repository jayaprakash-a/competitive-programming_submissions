# Description

Given two binary trees `node0` and `node1`, return a merge of the two trees where each value is equal to the sum of the values of the corresponding nodes of the input trees. If only one input tree has a node in a given position, the corresponding node in the new tree should match that input node.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `node0`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the number of nodes in `node1`
