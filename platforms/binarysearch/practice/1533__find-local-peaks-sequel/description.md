# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums`. Return the index of every peak in the list, sorted in ascending order. An index `i` is called a peak if all three conditions are true:

- The next number on its right that's different than `nums[i]` doesn't exist or is smaller than `nums[i]`
- The next number on its left that's different than `nums[i]` doesn't exist or is smaller than `nums[i]`
- There is at least one number on its left or its right that's different than `nums[i]`

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
