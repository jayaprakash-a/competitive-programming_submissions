# Description

Given a list of integers `nums`, return whether it represents a max heap. That is, for every `i` we have that:

- `nums[i] ≥ nums[2*i + 1]` if `2*i + 1` is within bounds
- `nums[i] ≥ nums[2*i + 2]` if `2*i + 2` is within bounds

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
