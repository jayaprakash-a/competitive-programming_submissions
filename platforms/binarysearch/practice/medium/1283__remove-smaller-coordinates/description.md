# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `coordinates` where each element contains `(x, y)` representing a coordinate in a Cartesian plane.

Remove every point `(a, b)` if there's another point `(c, d)` such that `a ≤ c` and `b ≤ d`. The relative ordering of the original list should be maintained.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `coordinates`
