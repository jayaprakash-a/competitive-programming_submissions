# Description

Implement the tic-tac-toe game with the following methods:

- `TicTacToe(int n)` which instantiates an `n x n` game board. A player wins a game if their pieces either form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of length `n`.
- `int move(int r, int c, boolean me)` which places the next move at row `r` and column `c`. `me` indicates whether it's my move (`me = true)` or it's your opponent's (`me = false`) move. If this move makes you win, return `1`, if your opponent wins, return `-1`, and otherwise return `0`.



**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the number of calls to `move`
