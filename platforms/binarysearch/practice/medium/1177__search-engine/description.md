# Description

Implement a data structure with the following methods:

- `add(String word)` which adds a lowercase alphabet string `word` to the search engine
- `exists(String word)` which checks if `word` is in the engine. `word` may contain `"."` which means to match any character

**Constraints**
- `k ≤ 1,000` where k is the length of `word`
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `add` and `exists`
