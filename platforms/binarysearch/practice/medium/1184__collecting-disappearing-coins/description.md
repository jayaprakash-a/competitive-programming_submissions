# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix` where each `matrix[r][c]` represents the number of coins in that cell. When you pick up coins on `matrix[r][c]`, all the coins on row `r - 1` and `r + 1` disappear, as well as the coins at the two cells `matrix[r][c + 1]` and `matrix[r][c - 1]`. Return the maximum number of coins that you can collect.

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
