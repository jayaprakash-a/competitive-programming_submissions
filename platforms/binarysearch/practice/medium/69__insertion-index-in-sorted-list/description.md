# Description

Given a list of integers `nums`, sorted in ascending order, and a number `target`, return the index where `target` should be inserted to keep `nums` sorted. If `target` already exists in `nums`, return the largest index where `target` can be inserted.

This should be done in `$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
