# Description

Given a binary tree `root`, return the maximum sum of a subtree. A subtree is defined to be some node in `root` including all of its descendants. A subtree sum is the sum of all the node values in the subtree. A subtree can be null in which case its sum is `0`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `root`
