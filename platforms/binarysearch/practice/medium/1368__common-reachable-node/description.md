# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `edges` representing a directed graph and integers `a` and `b`. Each element in `edges` contains `[u, v]` meaning there's an edge from `u` to `v`.

Return whether there's some node `c` such that we can go from `c` to `a` and `c` to `b`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `edges`
