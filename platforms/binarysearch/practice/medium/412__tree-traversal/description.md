# Description

You are given a tree `root` and a list of strings `moves` consisting of `"RIGHT"`, `"LEFT"` and `"UP"`. Starting from `root`, traverse the tree by performing each move in `moves` where:

- `"RIGHT"` means to traverse to the right child.
- `"LEFT"` means to traverse to the left child.
- `"UP"` means to traverse to its parent.

Return the value of the last node after all moves. You can assume that the moves are valid.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `root`
