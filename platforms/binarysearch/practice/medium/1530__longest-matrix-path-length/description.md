# Description

You are given a two dimensional integer `matrix` where `0` is an empty cell and `1` is a wall. You can start at any empty cell on row `0` and want to end up on any empty cell on row `n - 1`. Given that you can move left, right, or down, return the longest such path where you visit each cell at most once. If there is no viable path, return `0`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n * m ≤ 200,000` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`.
