# Description

You are given an N by M matrix of `0`s and `1`s. Starting from the top left corner, how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner? Mod the result by `10 ** 9 + 7`.

You can only move right and down. `0` represents an empty space while `1` represents a wall you cannot walk through. The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be `0`.

**Constraints**

- `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`.
