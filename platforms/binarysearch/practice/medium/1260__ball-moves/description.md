# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` containing `0`s and `1`s where a `0` means the cell is empty and `1` means there's a ball there.

Return a new list of integers `A` of the same length where `A[i]` is set to the total distance required to move all the balls to `A[i]`. The distance to move a ball in index `j` to index `i` is defined to be `abs(j - i)`.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
