# Description

Given a binary tree `root`, return the depth of the second deepest [leaf]{data-definition=leaf}. Note that if there are multiple deepest leaves, the second deepest leaf is the next highest one.

The root has a depth of `0` and you can assume the answer is guaranteed to exist for the trees given.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `root`.
