# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` and a two-dimensional list of integers `queries`. Each element in `queries` contains `[i, j]` and asks what is the value of `nums[i] ^ nums[i + 1] ^ ... ^ nums[j]`. Return a list containing the answer for each query.

**Constraints**
- `i ≤ j`
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `queries`
