# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` of even length. Consider an operation where you pick any number in `nums` and update it with a value between `[1, max(nums)]`.

Return the minimum number of operations required such that for every `i`, `nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i]` equals to the same number.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10,000 `
