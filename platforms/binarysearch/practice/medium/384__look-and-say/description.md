# Description

The "look and say" sequence is defined as follows: beginning with the term `1`, each subsequent term visually describes the digits appearing in the previous term. The first few terms are as follows:

```
1
11 <- 1 one
21 <- 2 ones
1211 <- 1 two, 1 one
111221 <- 1 one, 1 two, 2 ones
312211 <- 3 ones, 2 twos, 1 one
```

Given an integer `n`, return the `n`th term of this sequence as a string.
