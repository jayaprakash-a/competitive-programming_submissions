Given a string `text` and a list of strings `patterns`, implement an embolden function where all substrings in `text` that match any string in `patterns` are wrapped in `**` and `**` tags. If two patterns are adjacent or overlap, they should be merged into one tag.

**Constraints**

- `n < 5000` where `n` is the length of `text`
- `m < 100` where `m` is the length of `patterns`
