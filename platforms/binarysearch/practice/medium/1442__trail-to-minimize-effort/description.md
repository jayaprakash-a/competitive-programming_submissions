# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix` where element represents the height of a hill. You are currently on the top left cell and want to go to the bottom right cell. In each move, you can go up, down, left, or right. A path's cost is defined to the largest absolute difference of heights between any two consecutive cells in the path. Return the minimum cost of any path.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
