# Description

You are given an integer `height` and a list of integers `blacklist`. You are currently standing at height `height` and you are playing a game to move a small ball down to height `0`.

In even rounds (`0`, `2`, `4`, `6` etc.) you can move the ball down `1`, `2`, or `4` stairs down. In odd rounds, you can move the ball down `1`, `3`, or `4` stairs. There are some levels of the stairs where if the ball lands there, it will die as labelled in `blacklist`. Return number of ways you can move the ball down to height `0`. Mod the result by `10 ** 9 + 7`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ height ≤ 100,000`
- `0 ≤ b ≤ 100,000` where `b` is the length of `blacklist`
