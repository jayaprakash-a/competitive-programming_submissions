# Description

You are given a lowercase alphabet string `s` and a two-dimensional list of strings `pairs`. Each element in `pairs` contains `[a, b]` meaning that character `a` and `b` are considered equivalent. We say that if `a` and `b` are equivalent and `b` and `c` are equivalent, then `a` and `c` are also equivalent. Also, any character `a` is equivalent to itself.

Return whether `s` is a palindrome given the equivalence relations.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s`
- `0 ≤ p ≤ 100,000` where `p` is the length of `p`
