# Description

You are given a circular list of integers `nums`. That is, the first element and the last element are neighbors.

Starting from any index `i`, you can move `nums[i]` number of steps forward if it's positive and backwards if it's negative. Return whether there's a cycle of length greater than one such that the path only goes forwards or only goes backwards.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
