# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer `matrix` of `2`s, `1`s, and `0`s, where a `2` represents an enemy, `1` represents a wall and `0` represents an empty cell. You can place a bomb in an empty cell and when a bomb explodes, all the spaces along on the same row and column are damaged until there's a wall.

Return the maximum number of enemies you can damage by placing one bomb.

**Constraints**

- `n * m â‰¤ 200,000` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`.
