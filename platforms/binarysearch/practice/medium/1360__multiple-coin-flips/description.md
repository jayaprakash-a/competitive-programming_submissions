# Description

You are given a list of floats `chances` and an integer `target`. Each element `chances[i]` represents the probability that the `i`th coin lands heads on a flip.

Given that we throw each coin once, return the probability that exactly `target` number of them land heads.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `chances`
- `0 ≤ chances[i] ≤ 1`
- `0 ≤ target ≤ 1,000`
