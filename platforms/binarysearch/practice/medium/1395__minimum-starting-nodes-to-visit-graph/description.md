# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `edges` representing a connected, directed, acyclic graph. Each element in `edges` contains `[u, v]` meaning there is an edge from `u` to `v`. Return the minimum list of nodes from which we can visit every node in the graph, sorted in ascending order.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `edges`
