# Description

Implement a data structure with the following methods:

- `void appendLeft(int val)` when appends `val` to the left of the deque.
- `int popLeft()` which pops the leftmost value of the deque. If it's empty, return `-1`.
- `void append(int val)` when appends `val` to the end of the deque.
- `int pop()` which pops the last value of the deque. If it's empty, return `-1`.
- `void appendMiddle(int val)` when appends `val` to the middle of the deque.
- `int popMiddle()` which pops the middle value of the deque. If it's empty, return `-1`.

Middle is defined to be `floor(k / 2)` where `k` is the length of the deque.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to any method.
