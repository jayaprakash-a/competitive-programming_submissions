# Description

You are given two-dimensional lists of integers `a` and `b`, both of which contains `0`s and `1`s. A `1` represents land and `0` represents water, so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water.

Return the number of islands that exist in both `a` and `b` at the exact same coordinates. 

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n * m ≤ 200,000` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `a` and `b`
