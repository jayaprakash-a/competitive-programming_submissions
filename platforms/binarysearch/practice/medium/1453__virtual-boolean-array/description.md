# Description

Implement a boolean array which implements the following methods:

- `BooleanArray()` which initializes an array of size `2 ** 31` with all false values.
- `void setTrue(int i)` which sets the value at index `i` to true.
- `void setFalse(int i)` which sets the value at index `i` to false.
- `void setAllTrue()` which sets the value at every index to true.
- `void setAllFalse()` which sets the value at every index to false.
- `boolean getValue(int i)` which returns the value at index `i`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of method calls
