# Description

You are given a list of positive integers `nums`. Consider an operation where you pick a number, remove it and increase your score by the sum of the number and its two adjacent numbers.

You can perform this operation as many times you want as long as you don't pick the first or the last number in the list. Return the maximal score possible.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100` where `n` is the length of `nums`
