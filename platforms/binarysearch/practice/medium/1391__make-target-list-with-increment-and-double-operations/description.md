# Description

You are given a list of non-negative integers `target`. Consider a list `A` of the same length as `target` containing all zeros initially. In one operation, you can increment one number in `A`, or double every number in `A`. Return the minimum number of operations required to turn `A` into `target`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `target`
