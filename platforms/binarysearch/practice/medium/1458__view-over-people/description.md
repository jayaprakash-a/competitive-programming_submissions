# Description

You are given a list of integers `heights` and an integer `k`. Each element `heights[i]` represents the height of the `i`th person. The `i`th person can see the movie if all `k` people directly to the right of them are shorter. If there’s fewer than `k` people to the right then they can see the movie if all remaining people to the right are shorter.

Return the people that can see the movie, sorted in ascending order.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `heights`
