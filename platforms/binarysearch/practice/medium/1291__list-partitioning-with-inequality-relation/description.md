# Description

Given a list of integers `nums`, we want to split the list into two non-empty sublists `a` and `b` such that every element in `a` is less than or equal to every element in `b`.


Return the smallest length of `a` that is possible. You can assume that the solution exists.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
