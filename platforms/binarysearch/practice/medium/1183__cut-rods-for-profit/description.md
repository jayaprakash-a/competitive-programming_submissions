# Description

You are given a list of integers `rod\_lens`, where each element represents the length of a rod. You are also given integers `profit\_per\_len` and `cost\_per\_cut`. You make `profit\_per\_len` profit per unit length of a rod but you can only sell rods that are all of the same length. You can also cut a rod into two integer pieces but each cut costs `cost\_per\_cut`. You can cut a rod as many times as you want. Return the maximum profit that can be made.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `rod\_lens`
- `m ≤ 1,000` where `m` is the maximum value in `rod\_lens`
