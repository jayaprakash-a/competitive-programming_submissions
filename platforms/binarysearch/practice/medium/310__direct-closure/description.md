# Description

Given a two-dimensional list of integers `graph` representing an undirected graph as an adjacency list, return a two-dimensional matrix `M` where

- `M[i][j] = 1` if there is a path between vertices `i` and `j`.
- `M[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n * m ≤ 100,000` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `graph`
