# Description

Given list of integers `nums` and integer `k`, return the number of non-empty subsets `S` such that `min(S) + max(S) ≤ k`.

Note: For this problem, the subsets are [multisets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset). That is, there can be duplicate values in the subsets since they refer to specific elements of the list, not values.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
