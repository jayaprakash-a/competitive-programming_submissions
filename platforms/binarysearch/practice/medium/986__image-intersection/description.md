# Description

You are given two-dimensional integer matrices `matrix` and `target` with the same dimensions containing `1`s and `0`s. Given that you can shift `matrix` left, right, up or down any number of times, return the maximum number of cells you can have where both `matrix` and `target` have `1`s.

For example, given this matrix

```
[0, 1, 1]
[1, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 0]
```
If you shift it right once, you'd get
```
[0, 0, 1]
[0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 1]
```

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 100` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
