# Description

Given a list of strings `sentence` where each `sentence[i]` is a string with single character, reverse the order of the words in the sentence.

You may assume there's no extraneous spaces in the `sentence`. Can you do modify `sentence` in-place and solve in `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` space?

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 10,000` where `n` is the length of `sentence`.
