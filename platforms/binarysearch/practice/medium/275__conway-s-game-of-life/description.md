# Description

You are given a two dimensional `matrix` where a `1` represents a live cell and a `0` represents a dead cell. A cell's (living or dead) neighbors are its immediate horizontal, vertical and diagonal cells. Compute the next state of the matrix using these rules:

- Any living cell with two or three living neighbors lives.
- Any dead cell with three living neighbors becomes a live cell.
- All other cells die.

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 500` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
