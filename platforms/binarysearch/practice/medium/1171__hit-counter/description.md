# Description

Implement a hit counter which keeps track of number of the number of hits in the last `60` seconds.

- `add(int timestamp)` which adds `timestamp` in seconds in the hit counter
- `count(int timestamp)` which returns the number of hits that have been made in the last `60` seconds, given the current time is `timestamp`.

You can assume that the timestamps passed into `add` and `count` are [monotonically increasing]{data-definition=monotonically-increasing}.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls that are made to `add` and `count`
