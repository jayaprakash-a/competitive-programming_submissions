# Description

Implement a data structure with the following metehods:

- `bool create(String path, int content)` which creates a path at `path` if there's a parent directory and `path` doesn't exist yet, and sets its value as `content`. Returns whether it was newly created. Initially only the root directory at `"/"` exists.
- `int get(String path)` which returns the value associated with `path`. If there's no path, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `create` and `get`
