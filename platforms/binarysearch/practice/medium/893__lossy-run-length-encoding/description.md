# Description

You are given a lowercase alphabet string `s` and an integer `k`. Consider an operation where we perform a run-length encoding on a string by representing repeated successive characters as a count and character. For example, the string `"aabbbc"` would be encoded as `"2a3bc"`. Note that we don't put `"1c"` for `"c"` since it only appears once successively.

Given that you can first remove any `k` consecutive characters in `s`, return the minimum length possible of the resulting run-length encoding.

**Constraints**
- `k ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s`.
