# Description

Implement an iterator of two-dimensional list of integers `lists`.

- `next()` polls the next element in the iterator, iterating over each row in `lists`
- `hasnext()` which returns whether the next element exists

For example:
```
it = TwoDimensionalIterator([[1, 2],[3, 4],[5]])
it.next() == 1
it.next() == 2
it.next() == 3
it.hasnext() == True
it.next() == 4
it.next() == 5
it.hasnext() == False
```

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `next` and `hasnext`

**Notes**
- Your iterator should use `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` extra space.
