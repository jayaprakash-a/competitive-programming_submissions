# Description

You are given a unique two-dimensional list of integers `points` where each element `points[i]` contains `(x, y)` representing a Cartesian coordinate.

For each point `i` in `points`, return the shortest Manhattan distance to a different point that is either in the same `y` coordinate or the same `x` coordinate.

You can assume that every point has some other point that either share the same `x` or `y` coordinate.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `points`
