# Description

You are given a list of lists `intervals` where each list contains `[start, end)` and a list of strings `types`. For a given `i`, `intervals[i]` represents the times someone worked on the job `types[i]` from `[start, end)`. 

You can assume that two intervals of the same type never overlap or touch.

Return a sorted merged list of lists where each element contains `[start, end, num\_types]`, meaning from `start` to `end`, `num\_types` number of tasks were being worked on.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `intervals`
