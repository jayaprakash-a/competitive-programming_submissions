# Description

There's a staircase with `n` steps, and you can climb up either `1` or `2` steps at a time.

Given an integer `n`, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters, so each different order of steps counts as a way.

Mod the result by `10 ** 9 + 7`.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000`
