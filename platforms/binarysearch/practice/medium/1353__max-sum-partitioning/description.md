# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. You must partition `nums` into contiguous groups of size at most `k` each, and then set each [element]{data-definition=element} in `nums` to the maximum value of its group.

Return the maximum possible sum of the resulting list after partitioning.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `1 ≤ k ≤ n`
