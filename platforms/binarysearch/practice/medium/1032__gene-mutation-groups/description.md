# Description

You are given a list of unique strings `genes` where each element has the same length and contains characters `"A"`, `"C"`, `"G"` and/or `"T"`.

- If strings `a` and `b` are the same string except for one character, then `a` and `b` are in the same mutation group.
- If strings `a` and `b` are in a group and `b` and `c` are in a group, then `a` and `c` are in the same group.

Return the total number of mutation groups.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 10,000`
- `k ≤ 20` where `k` is the length of a string in `genes`
