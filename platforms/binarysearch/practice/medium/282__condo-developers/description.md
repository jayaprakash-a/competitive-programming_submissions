# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer `matrix`, where `matrix[r][c]` represents the height of a condominium in a city.

The west-east skyline can be seen by taking the maximum of each row in the `matrix`. Similarly, the north-south skyline can be seen by taking the maximum of each column.

Return a new matrix where each condominium's height is increased to the maximum possible height while keeping the same west-east and north-south skyline.

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
