# Description

Given four lists of integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and an integer `target`, return the number of unique quadruple `i, j, k, l` such that `a[i] + b[j] + c[k] + d[l] = target`.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `a`
- `m ≤ 1,000` where `m` is the length of `b`
- `p ≤ 1,000` where `p` is the length of `c`
- `q ≤ 1,000` where `q` is the length of `d`
