# Description

You are given a singly linked list `node` and an integer `k`. Order the linked list so that all nodes whose values are less than `k` come first, all nodes whose values are equal to `k` next, and then other nodes last.

The relative ordering of the nodes should remain the same.

Bonus: Can you do it in `$\mathcal{O}(n)$` time and `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` space?

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `node`
