# Description

You are given a binary tree `root` containing unique values, and an integer `target`. Find the node with value `target` and return the node that's directly right of it on its level. If the target node doesn't exist or if it's already in the rightmost position, return null.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `root`
