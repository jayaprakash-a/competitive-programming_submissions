# Description

Given a binary search tree `root` containing unique values, and an integer `t`, return the value of the inorder successor of `t`. That is, return the smallest value greater than `t` in the tree.

Note: you can assume that the inorder successor exists.

Bonus: solve it in `$\mathcal{O}(h)$` time and `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` space where `h` is the height of the tree.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `root`
