# Description

A distance of a lowercase alphabet character is defined to be its index (1-indexed) in the alphabet. For example `"a"` is `1`, `"b"` is `2` and `"z"` is `26`. The distance of a lowercase alphabet string is the sum of its character distances.

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the [lexicographically]{data-definition=lexicographic-list-string} smallest lowercase alphabet string of length `k` whose distance is equal to `n`.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000`
- `n ≤ k`
