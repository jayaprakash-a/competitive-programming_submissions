# Description

Given a singly linked list `node`, reorder it such that we take: the last node, and then the first node, and then the second last node, and then the second node, etc.

Can you do it in `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` space?

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `node`
