# Description

Given three integer lists `a`, `b` and `c`, find the minimum possible `abs(a[i] - b[j]) + abs(b[j] - c[k])` for any `i`, `j` and `k`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `a`
- `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `b`
- `1 ≤ k ≤ 100,000` where `k` is the length of `c`
