# Description

Given a list of strings `strs`, containing the strings `"red"`, `"green"` and `"blue"`, partition the list so that the red come before green, which come before blue. 

This should be done in `$\mathcal{O}(n)$` time.

Bonus: Can you do it in `$\mathcal{O}(1)$` space? That is, can you do it by only rearranging the list (i.e. without creating any new strings)?

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `strs`.
