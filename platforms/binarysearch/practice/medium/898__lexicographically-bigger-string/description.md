# Description

Given lowercase alphabet strings `s` and `t` of the same length, return whether there's some anagram of `s`, say `a`, and some anagram of `t`, say `b`, such that:

- `a[i] ≤ b[i]` for all `0 ≤ i < n` or
- `b[i] ≤ a[i]` for all `0 ≤ i < n`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n = m ≤ 100,000` where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `s` and `t`.
