# Description

You are given a list of integers `tasks` where each different integer represents a different task type, and a non-negative integer `k`. Each task takes one minute to complete, but you must wait `k` minutes between doing two tasks of the same type. At any time, you can be doing a task or waiting.

Return the smallest amount of time it takes to complete all the tasks. 

**Constraints**

- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `tasks`
- `0 ≤ k`
