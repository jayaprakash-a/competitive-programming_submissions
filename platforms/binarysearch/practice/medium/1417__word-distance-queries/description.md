# Description

Implement a data structure with the following methods:

- `WordDistanceQuerier(String[] words)` which constructs the instance.
- `distance(String a, String b)` which returns the shortest distance between word `a` and `b` in `words`. You can assume that `a` and `b` exists in `words` and `a ≠ b`.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 10,000` where `n` is the length of `words`
- `m ≤ 1,000` where `m` is the number of calls to `distance`
