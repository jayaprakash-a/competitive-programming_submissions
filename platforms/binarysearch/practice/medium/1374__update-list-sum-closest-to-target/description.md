# Description

You are given a list of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`. Find the smallest number `e ≥ 0` (not necessarily from `nums`) such that if we update every number in `nums` greater than `e` to `e`, the resulting list's sum would be closest in absolute value to `target`. 

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
