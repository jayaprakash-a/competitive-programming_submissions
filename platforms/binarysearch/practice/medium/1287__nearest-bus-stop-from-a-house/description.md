- `0` represents an empty cell
- `1` represents a wall
- `2` represents a house
- `3` represents a bus stop

Return the shortest distance from any house to any bus stop. You can move up, down, left, and right but you can't move through a house or a wall cell. If there's no solution, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
