# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix` where `matrix[r][c]` represents the height of that cell. 

You are currently at top left corner and want to go to the bottom right. You can move to nearby cells (up, down, left, right) only if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height.

Given that you can increase the height of any number of cells before you move, return the minimum total height that needs to be increased so that you can go to the bottom right cell.

**Constraints**
- `n * m * h â‰¤ 1,000,000` where `n`, `m` are the number of rows and columns and `h` is the number of distinct values in `matrix`.
