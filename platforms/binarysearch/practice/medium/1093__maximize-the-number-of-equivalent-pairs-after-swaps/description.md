# Description

You are given a list of integers of the same length `A` and `B`. You are also given a two-dimensional list of integers `C` where each element is of the form `[i, j]` which means that you can swap `A[i]` and `A[j]` as many times as you want.

Return the maximum number of pairs where `A[i] = B[i]` after the swapping.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `A` and `B`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `C`
