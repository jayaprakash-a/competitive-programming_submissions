# Description

Implement a data structure with the following methods:

- `SnapshottableList(int size)` which instantiates the list with the given `size`. The initial value of each element is `0`.
- `void set(int idx, int val)` which sets the value at index `idx` to `val`.
- `int snapshot()` which returns the number of times `snapshot` was called previously.
- `int get(int idx, int snapshotId)` which returns the value at index `idx` after we took snapshot `snapshotId`. You can assume that `snapshotId` is valid.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of calls to `set`, `snapshot` and `get`
- `0 ≤ size ≤ 100,000`
