# Description

You are given a list of integers `bricks` and integers `width` and `height`. Each `bricks[i]` represents a `1 x bricks[i]` size brick. Return the number of ways to lay the bricks such that we get full layout of bricks with width `width` and height `height`. Bricks can be reused but can only be laid horizontally.

Answer fits within 32-bit integer.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `bricks`
- `1 ≤ width * n ≤ 100,000`
