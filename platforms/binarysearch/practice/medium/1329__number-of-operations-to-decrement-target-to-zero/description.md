# Description

You are given a list of positive integers `nums` and an integer `target`. Consider an operation where we remove a number `v` from either the front or the back of `nums` and decrement `target` by `v`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to decrement `target` to zero. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
