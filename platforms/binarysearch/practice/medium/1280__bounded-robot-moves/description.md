# Description

You are given a string `s` representing the moves of a robot that is currently at `(0, 0)` and is facing north. Each move consists of either

- `"F"` which means the robot moved one unit forward
- `"L"` which means the robot turned `90` degrees left
- `"R"` which means the robot turned `90` degrees right

Given that the robot repeatedly makes the moves in `s` in order, return whether there is some box in the plane in which the robot never leaves.


**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s`
