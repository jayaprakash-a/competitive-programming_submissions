# Description

You are given two lists of integers `a` and `b` representing sensor metrics. Each list contains unique integers and `a ≠ b`. One of the lists contains accurate sensor metrics but the other one is faulty. In the faulty list one number that wasn't the last number was dropped and a fake value was appended to the end of the list. Return the number that was dropped.

**Constraints**
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `a` and `b`
