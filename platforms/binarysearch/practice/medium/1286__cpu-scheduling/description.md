# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `tasks`. Each element contains `[id, queue\_time, duration]` which represents a CPU task with id `id`, queued at time `queue\_time`, that will run for `duration` amount of time. All tasks have unique ids.

Given that the CPU scheduler will run a job that is currently in the queue with the lowest duration first, return the order of job ids that will be processed. If there's more than one job with the lowest duration, then it will run the job with lowest `id` first.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `tasks`
