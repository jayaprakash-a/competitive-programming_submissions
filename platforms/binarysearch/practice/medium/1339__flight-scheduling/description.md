# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `costs`. Each `costs[i]` contains `[a, b]` meaning that for person `i` it costs `a` to go to city `0` and costs `b` to go to city `1`.

Given that we want the same number of people to go to city `0` as city `1`, return the minimum cost required.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `costs`
- `n % 2 = 0`
