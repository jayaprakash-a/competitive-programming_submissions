# Description

You are given two lists of integers `a` and `b` as well as integers `lower` and `upper`. Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `lower ≤ a[i] * a[i] + b[j] * b[j] ≤ upper`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `a`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `b`
