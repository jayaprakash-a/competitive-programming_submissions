# Description

Given a binary tree `root` containing unique values and an integer `k`, return the number of k-length unique paths in the tree. Paths can go either parent to child or child to parent. Two paths are different if some node appears in one path but not the other.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `root`
- `2 ≤ k ≤ 20`
