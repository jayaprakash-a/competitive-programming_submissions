# Description

You are given two lists of integers `weights` and `values` which have the same length and an integer `capacity`. `weights[i]` and `values[i]` represent the weight and value of the `i`th item.

Given that you can take at most `capacity` weights, and that you can take any number of copies for each item, return the maximum amount of value you can get.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 250` where `n` is the length of `weights` and `values`
- `capacity ≤ 250`
