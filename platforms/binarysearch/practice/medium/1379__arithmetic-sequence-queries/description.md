# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` and a two-dimensional list of integers `queries`. Each element in `queries` contains `[i, j]` and asks whether the sublist of `nums` from `[i, j]`, inclusive, is an [arithmetic sequence]{data-definition=arithmetic-sequence}. Return the number of queries that are true.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `queries`
