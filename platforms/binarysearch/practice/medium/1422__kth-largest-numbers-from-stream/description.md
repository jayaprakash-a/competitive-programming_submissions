# Description

Implement a data structure with the following methods:

- `KthLargestStream(int[] nums, int k)` which constructs the instance.
- `int add(int val)` which adds `val` to `nums` and returns the `k` (0-indexed) largest value in `nums`

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the number of calls to `add`
- `k + 1 ≤ n`
