# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix`. You are currently at the top left corner and want to move to the bottom right corner. In each move, you can move down or right.

Return the maximum product of the cells visited by going to the bottom right cell. If the result is negative, return `-1`. Otherwise, mod the result by `10 ** 9 + 7`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 20` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
- `-2 ≤ matrix[r][c] ≤ 2`
