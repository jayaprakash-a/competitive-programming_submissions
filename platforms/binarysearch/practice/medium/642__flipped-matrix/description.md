# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer `matrix` containing `0` and `1`. For any row or column in the matrix you can toggle all the bits such that all the `1`s become `0` and all the `0`s become `1`. 

Given you can make any number of these operations, and that we treat each row as a binary number, return the largest sum that can be made of these numbers.

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 30` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`.
