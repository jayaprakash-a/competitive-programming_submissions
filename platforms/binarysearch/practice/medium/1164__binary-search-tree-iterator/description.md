# Description

Implement a binary search tree iterator with the following methods:

- `next` returns the next smallest element in the tree
- `hasnext` returns whether there is a next element in the iterator

For example, given the following tree

```
 4
 / \
 2 7
 / \
 5 9
```

It should return the values in this order `2`, `4`, `5`, `7`, `9`.
