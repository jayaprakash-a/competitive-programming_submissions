# Description

Implement a data structure `VirtuallyCloneableStacks` with the following methods

- `VirtuallyCloneableStacks()` which initializes an empty stack at index `0`.
- `copyPush(i)` which clones the stack at index `i`, pushes an element to the clone, and then pushes the clone into the list of stacks.
- `copyPop(i)` which clones the stack at index `i`, pops an element from the clone, and then pushes the clone into the list of stacks.
- `size(i)` which returns the number of elements in stack at index `i`.

You can assume that each call will be valid. For example, a stack won't be popped from an empty stack, and `i` will be in bounds.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of method calls.
