# Description

You are given a binary tree `root` containing values `0`, `1` and `2`. The root has at least one `0` node and one `1` node. Consider an operation where we delete an edge in the tree and the tree becomes disjoint with two trees.

Return the number of ways we can delete one edge such that none of the two trees contain both a `0` node and a `1` node.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the number of nodes in `root`
