# Description

Implement a data structure `LastValueMap` which has the following methods:

- `void set(int key, int value)` which associates `key` with `value`.
- `void remove(int key)` which removes `key` and its associated `value`.
- `int getLast()` which returns the value of the last added key. If a `key` is updated with a value, it should become last. You can assume that there is always a last value.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 200,000` where `n` is the number of method calls
