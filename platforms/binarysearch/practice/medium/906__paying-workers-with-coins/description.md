# Description

You are given two lists of positive integers `coins` and `salaries`. `coins[i]` represents the value for coin `i` and `salaries[j]` represents the least amount of salary required to pay for worker `j`.

Assuming you have one coin per type and you must give each worker exactly one coin, compute the number of ways to give coins to each worker. Two ways are different if some worker receives one type of coin in one way but a different type of coin in the other way.

Return the result mod `10 ** 9 + 7`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `salaries` and `n` is the length of `coins`
- `1 ≤ salaries[i] ≤ 10 ** 9` for all `0 ≤ i < m`
- `1 ≤ coins[i] ≤ 10 ** 9` for all `0 ≤ i < n`
