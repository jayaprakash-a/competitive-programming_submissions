# Description

Given two integers `start` and `end`, return a sorted list of integers such that every number `e` is between `start ≤ e ≤ end` and the digits of `e` are contiguously increasing. For example, `2345` is contiguously increasing while `135` and `321` are not.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ start ≤ end < 2 ** 31`
