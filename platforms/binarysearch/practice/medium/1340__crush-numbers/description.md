# Description

You are given a list of positive integers `nums`. Consider an operation where we remove any two integers `a` and `b` with `a ≤ b` and if `a < b`, insert back `b - a` into `nums`.

Given that you can make any number of operations, return the smallest remaining number you can get. If the list becomes empty, return `0`.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 40` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100`
