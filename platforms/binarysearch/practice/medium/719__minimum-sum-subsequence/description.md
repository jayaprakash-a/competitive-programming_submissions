# Description

Given a list of positive integers `nums`, find a minimum sum [subsequence]{data-definition=subsequence-list-integer} from the list such that at least one integer for all groups of three consecutive integers is picked. Note that if the length of `nums` is less than `3`, a number should still be picked.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is length of `nums`
