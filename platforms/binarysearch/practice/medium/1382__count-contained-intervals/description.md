# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `intervals`. Each value is unique and contains an inclusive interval `[start, end]`. Return the number of intervals are contained by another interval. An interval that's contained by multiple other intervals should only be counted once.

An interval `[s0, e0]` contains another interval `[s1, e1]` if `s0 ≤ s1` and `e0 ≥ e1`.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `intervals`
