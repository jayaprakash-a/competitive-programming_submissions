# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` and integers `size` and `k`. Consider an operation where we take a contiguous sublist of length `size` and increment every element by one.

Given that you can perform this operation `k` times, return the largest minimum value possible in `nums`.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `k < 2 ** 31`
