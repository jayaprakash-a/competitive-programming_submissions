# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer matrix containing either a `0` or a `1`. A `0` signifies an empty space, and a `1` signifies a square with a person. A distance between two squares is defined as the maximum between the difference in x coordinates and the difference in y coordinates.

The grid is considered safe with a factor `k` if there is an empty square such that the distance from the square to each person in the grid, and each side of the grid is all greater or equal to `k`.

Return the maximum value of factor `k` for which you can be safe. 

**Constraints**
- `n, m â‰¤ 1,000`
- All of the outermost squares are guaranteed to be `1`.
