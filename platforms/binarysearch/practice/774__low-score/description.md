# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `edges` which represents an undirected graph. Each edge is of the form `[u, v, w]` which means nodes `u` and `v` are connected and have the weight `w`. The graph has `n` nodes from `0` to `n-1`.

The score of a path is defined as the product of the number of edges and the maximum weight for any edge in the path. Return the minimum score possible from node `0` to node `n-1`, or `-1` if no such path exists.

**Constraints**
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 1,000`
- `m ≤ 5,000` where `m` is the number of edges.
- The weight of each edge is at most `100,000`.
