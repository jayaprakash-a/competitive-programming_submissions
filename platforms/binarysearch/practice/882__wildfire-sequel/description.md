# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer matrix `matrix` where
- `0` represents empty cell
- `1` represents a person
- `2` represents fire
- `3` represents a wall

You can assume there's only one person and in each turn fire expands in all four directions although fire can't expand through walls.

Return whether the person can move to either the top left corner or the bottom right corner. In each turn, the person moves first, then the fire expands. If the person makes it to either square as the same time as the fire, then they're safe.

Note that if you go a the square and then the fire expands in the same turn to the same square, you still survive.

**Constraints**
- `1 â‰¤ n, m < 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
