# Description

You are given a list of lowercase alphabet strings `votes`, where each string represents votes on candidates in order from highest to lowest preference. A candidate's ranking depends first by the number of votes received on the highest preference. If there are ties, we go to the number of votes received on next highest preference, and so on. If there are still ties, then we rank them alphabetically.

Return the final ranking of the teams in order from highest to lowest ranked.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `votes`
