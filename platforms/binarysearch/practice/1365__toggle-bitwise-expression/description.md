# Description

You are given a string `s` representing a bitwise expression with the following characters: `"0"`, `"1"`, `"&"`, `"|"`, `"("`, and `")"`.

In one operation, you can:

- Toggle `"0"` to `"1"`
- Toggle `"1"` to `"0"`
- Change `"&"` to `"|"`
- Change `"|"` to `"&"`

Return the minimum number of operations required to toggle the value of the expression.

Note: the precedence of the operators don't matter, since they'll be wrapped in brackets when necessary. For example, `"1&0"` and `"1&(0&1)"` are possible inputs but `"1&0&1"` will not occur.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s`
