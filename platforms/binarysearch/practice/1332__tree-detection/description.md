# Description

You are given two lists of integers `left` and `right`, both of them the same length and representing a directed graph. `left[i]` is the index of node `i`'s left child and `right[i]` is the index of node `i`'s right child. A null child is represented by `-1`.

Return whether `left` and `right` represents a binary tree.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `left` and `right`
