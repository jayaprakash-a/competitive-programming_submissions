# Description

You are given a list of non-negative integers `nums` and a two-dimensional list of integers `queries` where each element contains `[x, limit]`.

Return a list such that for each query `[x, limit]`, we find an `e` in `nums` such that `e ≤ limit` and `XOR(e, x)` is maximized. If there's no such `e`, use `-1`.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `queries`
