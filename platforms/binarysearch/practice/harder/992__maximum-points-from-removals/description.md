# Description

You are given a list of positive integers `nums`. You can remove any contiguous sublist of some length `t` with the same value and get points `t * t`. Given that you can perform this any number of times until the list is empty, return the maximum number of points you can get.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100`
