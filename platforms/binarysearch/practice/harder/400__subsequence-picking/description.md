# Description

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you want to pick some [subsequences]{data-definition=subsequence-string} of `s` so that we have `k` unique subsequences. The cost of picking a subsequence equals `len(s) - len(subsequence)`. 

Return the minimum total cost possible after picking `k` unique subsequences. if there is no way to make this set, return `-1`.

Note: the empty string is also considered as a valid subsequence.

**Constraints**

- `n ≤ 1,000` where `n` is the length of `s`
- `k ≤ 100,000`
