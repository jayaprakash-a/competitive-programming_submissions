# Description

The power of a list is defined by the sum of `(index + 1) * value\_at\_index` over all indices. Or, you could say that it is:

```math
\sum\_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times \text{list}[i]
```

You are given a list `nums` of `n` positive integers. You can choose any single value in the list, and move (not swap) it to any position, including to the beginning of the list, or to the end. You may also choose to not move any position at all. What is the maximum possible final power of the list? Mod the result by `10 ** 9 + 7`.

**Constraints**

- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`
- `nums[i] ≤ 1,000`
