# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `tree` representing an n-ary tree and a list of integers `color`. The tree is represented as an adjacency list and is rooted at `tree[0]`. We have for the `i`th node:

- `tree[i]` represents its children and parent.
- `color[i]` represents its color.

A node `X` is considered "special" if every node in the subtree rooted at `X` has a unique color. Given the tree, return the number of special nodes.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `tree`.
