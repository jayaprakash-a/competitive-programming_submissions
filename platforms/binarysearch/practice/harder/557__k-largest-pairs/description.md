# Description

You are given two lists of integers `nums0`, `nums1` and an integer `k`. Find `k` largest sum pairs where each pair contains one integer in `nums0` and another in `nums1`, and return the sum of all of the pairs.

**Constraints**
- `0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums0`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `nums1`
- `0 ≤ k ≤ 100,000`
- `0 ≤ k ≤ n * m`
