# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `coordinates` where each element is in the form `[x, y]`, representing a Euclidean coordinate.

Return the smallest squared distance `$(x\_1-x\_2)^2 + (y\_1-y\_2)^2$` between any two coordinates.

**Constraints**
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `coordinates`
