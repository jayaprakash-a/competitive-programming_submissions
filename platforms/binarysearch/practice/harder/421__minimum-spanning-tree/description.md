# Description

You are given a two-dimensional integer matrix `edges`, representing an undirected graph. Each edge is of the form `(u, v, w)` which means nodes `u` and `v` are connected and have the weight `w`. You are also given integers `a` and `b`, which represent the edge `(a, b)`. Return whether there is some minimum spanning tree where `(a, b)` is one of its edges.

Note: the graph is connected and the edge `(a, b)` exists in the graph.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `edges`
