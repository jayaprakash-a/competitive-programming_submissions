# Description

You are given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Consider an operation where you increment some element by one. Given that you can perform this at most `k` times, return the value of the most frequently occurring number you can obtain. If there's more than one solution, pick the smallest possible number.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`
- `k < 2 ** 31`
