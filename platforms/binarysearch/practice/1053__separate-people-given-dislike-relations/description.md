# Description

You are given an integer `n` and a two-dimensional list of integers `enemies`. Integer `n` means there's `n` people labeled from `[0, n - 1]`. Each element in `enemies` contains `[person\_a, person\_b]` which means that `person\_a` and `person\_b` are enemies.

Return whether it's possible to partition the `n` people into two groups such that no two people that are enemies are in the same group.

**Constraints**
- `n ≤ 1,000`
- `m ≤ 10,000` where `m` is the length of `enemies`
