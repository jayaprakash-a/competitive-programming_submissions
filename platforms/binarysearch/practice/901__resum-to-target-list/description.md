# Description

You are given a list of integers `target`. Consider a list `X` with the same length as `target` containing all `1`s. You are able to perform this operation as many times as you'd like: Take some index `i` in `X` and set `X[i]` to the current sum of `X`. Return whether `X` can be turned into `target`.

**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `target`.
