# Description

You are given a list of flights that were taken, represented as origin to destination airport pairs. Given that this list was shuffled, find all the airports that were visited in the correct order. If there's more than one valid itinerary, return the [lexicographically]{data-definition=lexicographic-list-list-string} smallest ones first.

Note: airports **may** be visited twice.
