# Description

You're given integers `n` and `k`. Consider a string containing `"0"`, `"1"`, and `"2"`s where no character is repeated in succession. Take such strings of length `n` and return the `k`th (0-indexed) [lexicographically]{data-definition=lexicographic-list-string} smallest one. If there's no `k`th string, return `""`.
