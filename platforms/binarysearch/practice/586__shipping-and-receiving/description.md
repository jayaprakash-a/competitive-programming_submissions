# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `ports` where `ports[i]` represents the list of ports that port `i` is connected to. You are also given another two-dimensional list of integers `shipments` where each list of the form `[port\_i, port\_j]` which means there is a shipment request from `port\_i` to `port\_j`.

Given that the cost to ship `port\_i` to `port\_j` is the length of the shortest path from the two ports, return the total cost necessary to send all the shipments. If there's not a path between two ports, the cost is `0`.

**Constraints**
- `p ≤ 100` where `p` is the length of `ports`
- `s ≤ 10,000` where `s` is the length of `shipments`
