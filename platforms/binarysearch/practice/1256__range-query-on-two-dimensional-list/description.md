# Description

Implement a data structure with the following methods:

- `RangeSum(int[][] matrix)` constructs a new instance with the given `matrix`.
- `total(int row0, int col0, int row1, int col1)` returns the sum of all cells `matrix[r][c]` where `row0 ≤ r ≤ row1` and `col0 ≤ c ≤ col1`.

**Constraints**
- `n, m ≤ 250` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
- `k ≤ 100,000` where `k` is the number of calls to `total`
