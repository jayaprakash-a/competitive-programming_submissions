# Description

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `edges` where each element contains `[u, v, distance]` representing a weighted undirected graph. You are currently at node `0` and your home is the largest node. You can go from `u` to `v` if it's immediately connected and the shortest distance from `u` to home is larger than the shortest distance from `v` to home.

Return the number of unique paths possible to go from node `0` to home. Mod the result by `10 ** 9 + 7`.

**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `edges`
- `0 ≤ distance`
