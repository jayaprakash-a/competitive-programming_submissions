# Description

Given a string `path`, where `path[i] = 'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'` or `'W'`, each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin `(0, 0)` on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by `path`.


Return `true` *if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited*. Return `false` otherwise.


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** path = "NES"
**Output:** false 
**Explanation:** Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.

```

**Example 2:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/10/screen-shot-2020-06-10-at-123843-pm.png)

```

**Input:** path = "NESWW"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Notice that the path visits the origin twice.
```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= path.length <= 104`
* `path[i]` is either `'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'`, or `'W'`.
