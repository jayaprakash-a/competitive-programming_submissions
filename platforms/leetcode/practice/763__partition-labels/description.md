# Description

You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.


Return *a list of integers representing the size of these parts*.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
**Output:** [9,7,8]
**Explanation:**
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** s = "eccbbbbdec"
**Output:** [10]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= s.length <= 500`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
