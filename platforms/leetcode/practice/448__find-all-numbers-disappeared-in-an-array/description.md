# Description

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `nums[i]` is in the range `[1, n]`, return *an array of all the integers in the range* `[1, n]` *that do not appear in* `nums`.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
**Output:** [5,6]

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** nums = [1,1]
**Output:** [2]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 105`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= n`


 


**Follow up:** Could you do it without extra space and in `O(n)` runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
