# Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values*. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
**Output:** [[15,7],[9,20],[3]]

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** root = [1]
**Output:** [[1]]

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** root = []
**Output:** []

```

 


**Constraints:**


* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
* `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
