# Description

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return
_an array of **the squares of each number** sorted in non-decreasing order_.

**Example 1:**

```markdown
**Input:** nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
**Output:** [0,1,9,16,100]
**Explanation:** After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```

**Example 2:**

```markdown
**Input:** nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
**Output:** [4,9,9,49,121]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
-   `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
-   `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

**Follow up:** Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial,
could you find an `O(n)` solution using a different approach?
