# Description

The **beauty** of a string is the difference in frequencies between the most frequent and least frequent characters.


* For example, the beauty of `"abaacc"` is `3 - 1 = 2`.


Given a string `s`, return *the sum of **beauty** of all of its substrings.*


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** s = "aabcb"
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The substrings with non-zero beauty are ["aab","aabc","aabcb","abcb","bcb"], each with beauty equal to 1.
```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** s = "aabcbaa"
**Output:** 17

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= s.length <=500`
* `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
