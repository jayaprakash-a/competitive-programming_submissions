# Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the length of the longest path, where each node in the path has the same value*. This path may or may not pass through the root.


**The length of the path** between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** root = [5,4,5,1,1,5]
**Output:** 2

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** root = [1,4,5,4,4,5]
**Output:** 2

```

 


**Constraints:**


* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
* `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
* The depth of the tree will not exceed `1000`.
