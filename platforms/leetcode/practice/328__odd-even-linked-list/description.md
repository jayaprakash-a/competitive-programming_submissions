# Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return *the reordered list*.


The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.


Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.


You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.


 


**Example 1:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven-linked-list.jpg)

```

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** [1,3,5,2,4]

```

**Example 2:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven2-linked-list.jpg)

```

**Input:** head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
**Output:** [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `n ==`number of nodes in the linked list
* `0 <= n <= 104`
* `-106 <= Node.val <= 106`
