# Description

The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.


Given two integers `x` and `y`, return *the **Hamming distance** between them*.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** x = 1, y = 4
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** x = 3, y = 1
**Output:** 1

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `0 <= x, y <= 231 - 1`
