# Description

Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears **three times** except for one, which appears **exactly once**. *Find the single element and return it*.


You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** nums = [2,2,3,2]
**Output:** 3

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
**Output:** 99

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
* `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
* Each element in `nums` appears exactly **three times** except for one element which appears **once**.
