# Description

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an `m x n` matrix. This matrix has the following properties:


* Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
* The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
**Output:** true

```

**Example 2:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat2.jpg)

```

**Input:** matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
**Output:** false

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `m == matrix.length`
* `n == matrix[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104`
