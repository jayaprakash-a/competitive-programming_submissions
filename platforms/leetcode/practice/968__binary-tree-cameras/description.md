# Description

You are given the `root` of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.


Return *the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree*.


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** root = [0,0,null,0,0]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

```

 


**Constraints:**


* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
* `Node.val == 0`
