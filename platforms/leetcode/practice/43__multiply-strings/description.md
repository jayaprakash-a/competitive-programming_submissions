# Description

Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.


**Note:** You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
**Output:** "6"

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
**Output:** "56088"

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200`
* `num1` and `num2` consist of digits only.
* Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zero, except the number `0` itself.
