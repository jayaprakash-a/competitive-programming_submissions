# Description

You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer `val`.


Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals `val` and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return `null`.


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
**Output:** [2,1,3]

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
**Output:** []

```

 


**Constraints:**


* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 5000]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 107`
* `root` is a binary search tree.
* `1 <= val <= 107`
