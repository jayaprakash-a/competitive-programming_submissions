# Description

You are given the `head` of a linked list, and an integer `k`.


Return *the head of the linked list after **swapping** the values of the* `kth` *node from the beginning and the* `kth` *node from the end (the list is **1-indexed**).*


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
**Output:** [1,4,3,2,5]

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5
**Output:** [7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** head = [1], k = 1
**Output:** [1]

```

**Example 4:**



```

**Input:** head = [1,2], k = 1
**Output:** [2,1]

```

**Example 5:**



```

**Input:** head = [1,2,3], k = 2
**Output:** [1,2,3]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
* `1 <= k <= n <= 105`
* `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
