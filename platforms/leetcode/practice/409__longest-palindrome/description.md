# Description

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return *the length of the **longest palindrome*** that can be built with those letters.


Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** s = "abccccdd"
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:**
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** s = "a"
**Output:** 1

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** s = "bb"
**Output:** 2

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
* `s` consists of lowercase **and/or** uppercase English letters only.
