# Description

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.


Return *the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations*.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** s = "ABAB", k = 2
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** s = "AABABBA", k = 1
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= s.length <= 105`
* `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
* `0 <= k <= s.length`
