# Description

Return all **non-negative** integers of length `n` such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is `k`.


Note that **every** number in the answer **must not** have leading zeros. For example, `01` has one leading zero and is invalid.


You may return the answer in **any order**.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** n = 3, k = 7
**Output:** [181,292,707,818,929]
**Explanation:** Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading zeroes.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** n = 2, k = 1
**Output:** [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** n = 2, k = 0
**Output:** [11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99]

```

**Example 4:**



```

**Input:** n = 2, k = 2
**Output:** [13,20,24,31,35,42,46,53,57,64,68,75,79,86,97]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `2 <= n <= 9`
* `0 <= k <= 9`
