# Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the sum of divisors of the integers in that array that have exactly four divisors*. If there is no such integer in the array, return `0`.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** nums = [21,4,7]
**Output:** 32
**Explanation:** 
21 has 4 divisors: 1, 3, 7, 21
4 has 3 divisors: 1, 2, 4
7 has 2 divisors: 1, 7
The answer is the sum of divisors of 21 only.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** nums = [21,21]
**Output:** 64

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** 0

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
