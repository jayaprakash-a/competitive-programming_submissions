# Description

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return *the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping*.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
* `intervals[i].length == 2`
* `-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104`
