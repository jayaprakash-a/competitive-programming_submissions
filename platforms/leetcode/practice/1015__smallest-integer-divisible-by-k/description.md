# Description

Given a positive integer `k`, you need to find the **length** of the **smallest** positive integer `n` such that `n` is divisible by `k`, and `n` only contains the digit `1`.


Return *the **length** of* `n`. If there is no such `n`, return -1.


**Note:** `n` may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** k = 1
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** k = 2
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** k = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= k <= 105`
