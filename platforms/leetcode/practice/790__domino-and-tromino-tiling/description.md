# Description

You have two types of tiles: a `2 x 1` domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/15/lc-domino.jpg)
Given an integer n, return *the number of ways to tile an* `2 x n` *board*. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.


In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.


 


**Example 1:**
