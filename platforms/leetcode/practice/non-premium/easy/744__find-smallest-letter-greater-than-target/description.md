# Description

Given a characters array `letters` that is sorted in **non-decreasing** order and a character `target`, return *the smallest character in the array that is larger than* `target`.


**Note** that the letters wrap around.


* For example, if `target == 'z'` and `letters == ['a', 'b']`, the answer is `'a'`.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
**Output:** "c"

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
**Output:** "f"

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "d"
**Output:** "f"

```

**Example 4:**



```

**Input:** letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "g"
**Output:** "j"

```

**Example 5:**



```

**Input:** letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "j"
**Output:** "c"

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `2 <= letters.length <= 104`
* `letters[i]` is a lowercase English letter.
* `letters` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
* `letters` contains at least two different characters.
* `target` is a lowercase English letter.
