# Description

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`.


A string is **good** if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).


Return *the sum of lengths of all good strings in words*.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100`
* `words[i]` and `chars` consist of lowercase English letters.
