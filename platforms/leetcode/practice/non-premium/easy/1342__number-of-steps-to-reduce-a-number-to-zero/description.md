# Description

Given an integer `num`, return *the number of steps to reduce it to zero*.


In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by `2`, otherwise, you have to subtract `1` from it.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** num = 14
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** 
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** num = 8
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** 
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4. 
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** num = 123
**Output:** 12

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `0 <= num <= 106`
