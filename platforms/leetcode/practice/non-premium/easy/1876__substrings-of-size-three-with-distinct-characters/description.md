# Description

A string is **good** if there are no repeated characters.


Given a string `s`​​​​​, return *the number of **good substrings** of length **three** in* `s`​​​​​​.


Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.


A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** s = "xyzzaz"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz". 
The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** s = "aababcabc"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** There are 7 substrings of size 3: "aab", "aba", "bab", "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".
The good substrings are "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= s.length <= 100`
* `s`​​​​​​ consists of lowercase English letters.
