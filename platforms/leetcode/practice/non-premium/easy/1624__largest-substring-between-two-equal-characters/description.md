# Description

Given a string `s`, return *the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, excluding the two characters.* If there is no such substring return `-1`.


A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** s = "aa"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The optimal substring here is an empty substring between the two 'a's.
```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** s = "abca"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The optimal substring here is "bc".

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** s = "cbzxy"
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There are no characters that appear twice in s.

```

**Example 4:**



```

**Input:** s = "cabbac"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The optimal substring here is "abba". Other non-optimal substrings include "bb" and "".

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= s.length <= 300`
* `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
