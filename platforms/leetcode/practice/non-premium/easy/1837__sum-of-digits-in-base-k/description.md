# Description

Given an integer `n` (in base `10`) and a base `k`, return *the **sum** of the digits of* `n` ***after** converting* `n` *from base* `10` *to base* `k`.


After converting, each digit should be interpreted as a base `10` number, and the sum should be returned in base `10`.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** n = 34, k = 6
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** 34 (base 10) expressed in base 6 is 54. 5 + 4 = 9.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** n = 10, k = 10
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** n is already in base 10. 1 + 0 = 1.

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `2 <= k <= 10`
