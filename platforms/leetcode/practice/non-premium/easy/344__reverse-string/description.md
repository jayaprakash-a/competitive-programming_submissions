# Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
**Output:** ["o","l","l","e","h"]

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
**Output:** ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= s.length <= 105`
* `s[i]` is a [printable ascii character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).


 


**Follow up:** Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with `O(1)` extra memory.
