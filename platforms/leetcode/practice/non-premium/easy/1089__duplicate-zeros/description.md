# Description

Given a fixed-length integer array `arr`, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.


**Note** that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written. Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
**Output:** [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
**Explanation:** After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** arr = [1,2,3]
**Output:** [1,2,3]
**Explanation:** After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= arr.length <= 104`
* `0 <= arr[i] <= 9`
