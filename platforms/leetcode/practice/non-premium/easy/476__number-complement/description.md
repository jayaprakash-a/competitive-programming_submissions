# Description

The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.


* For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its **complement** is `"010"` which is the integer `2`.


Given an integer `num`, return *its complement*.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** num = 5
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** num = 1
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= num < 231`
