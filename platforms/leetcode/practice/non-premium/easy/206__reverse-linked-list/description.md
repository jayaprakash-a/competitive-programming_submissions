# Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return *the reversed list*.


 


**Example 1:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex1.jpg)

```

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** [5,4,3,2,1]

```

**Example 2:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)

```

**Input:** head = [1,2]
**Output:** [2,1]

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** head = []
**Output:** []

```

 


**Constraints:**


* The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
* `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`


 


**Follow up:** A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
