# Description

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return *the majority element*.


The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** nums = [3,2,3]
**Output:** 3

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
**Output:** 2

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
* `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`


 


**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?
