# Description

Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` *if and only if* `s` *can become* `goal` *after some number of **shifts** on* `s`.


A **shift** on `s` consists of moving the leftmost character of `s` to the rightmost position.


* For example, if `s = "abcde"`, then it will be `"bcdea"` after one shift.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
**Output:** true

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
**Output:** false

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100`
* `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase English letters.
