# Description

**Balanced** strings are those that have an equal quantity of `'L'` and `'R'` characters.


Given a **balanced** string `s`, split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.


Return *the maximum amount of split **balanced** strings*.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** s = "LLLLRRRR"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".

```

**Example 4:**



```

**Input:** s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", since each substring contains an equal number of 'L' and 'R'

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s[i]` is either `'L'` or `'R'`.
* `s` is a **balanced** string.
