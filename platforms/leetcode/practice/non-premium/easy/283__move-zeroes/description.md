# Description

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.


**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
**Output:** [1,3,12,0,0]

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** nums = [0]
**Output:** [0]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
* `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`


 


**Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?
