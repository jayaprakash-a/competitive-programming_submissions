# Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return*the **greatest common divisor** of the
smallest number and largest number in* `nums`.

The **greatest common divisor** of two numbers is the largest positive integer
that evenly divides both numbers.

**Example 1:**

```markdown
**Input:** nums = [2,5,6,9,10]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**
The smallest number in nums is 2.
The largest number in nums is 10.
The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```markdown
**Input:** nums = [7,5,6,8,3]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 8.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```markdown
**Input:** nums = [3,3]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 3.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`
-   `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
