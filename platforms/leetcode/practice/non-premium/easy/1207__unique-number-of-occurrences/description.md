# Description

Given an array of integers `arr`, write a function that returns `true` if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** arr = [1,2]
**Output:** false

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
**Output:** true

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
* `-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
