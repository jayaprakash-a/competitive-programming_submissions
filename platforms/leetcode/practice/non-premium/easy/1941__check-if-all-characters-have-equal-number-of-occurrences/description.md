# Description

Given a string `s`, return `true` *if* `s` *is a **good** string, or* `false` *otherwise*.


A string `s` is **good** if **all** the characters that appear in `s` have the **same** number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** s = "abacbc"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** s = "aaabb"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The characters that appear in s are 'a' and 'b'.
'a' occurs 3 times while 'b' occurs 2 times, which is not the same number of times.

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
