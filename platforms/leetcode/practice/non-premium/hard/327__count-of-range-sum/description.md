# Description

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `lower` and `upper`, return *the number of range sums that lie in* `[lower, upper]` *inclusive*.


Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between indices `i` and `j` inclusive, where `i <= j`.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The three ranges are: [0,0], [2,2], and [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** nums = [0], lower = 0, upper = 0
**Output:** 1

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
* `-105 <= lower <= upper <= 105`
* The answer is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.
