# Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the maximum difference between two successive elements in its sorted form*. If the array contains less than two elements, return `0`.


You must write an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses linear extra space.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** nums = [3,6,9,1]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** nums = [10]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0.

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`
