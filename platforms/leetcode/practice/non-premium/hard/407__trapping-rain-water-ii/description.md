# Description

Given an `m x n` integer matrix `heightMap` representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return *the volume of water it can trap after raining*.


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** heightMap = [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks.
We have two small pounds 1 and 3 units trapped.
The total volume of water trapped is 4.

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** heightMap = [[3,3,3,3,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,2,1,2,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,3,3,3,3]]
**Output:** 10

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `m == heightMap.length`
* `n == heightMap[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 200`
* `0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 2 * 104`
