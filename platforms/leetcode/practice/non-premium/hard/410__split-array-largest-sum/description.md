# Description

Given an array `nums` which consists of non-negative integers and an integer `m`, you can split the array into `m` non-empty continuous subarrays.


Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these `m` subarrays.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** nums = [7,2,5,10,8], m = 2
**Output:** 18
**Explanation:**
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5], m = 2
**Output:** 9

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** nums = [1,4,4], m = 3
**Output:** 4

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 106`
* `1 <= m <= min(50, nums.length)`
