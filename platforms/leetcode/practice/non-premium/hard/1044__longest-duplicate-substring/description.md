# Description

Given a string `s`, consider all *duplicated substrings*: (contiguous) substrings of s that occur 2 or more times. The occurrences may overlap.


Return **any** duplicated substring that has the longest possible length. If `s` does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is `""`.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** s = "banana"
**Output:** "ana"

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** s = "abcd"
**Output:** ""

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `2 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
