# Description

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return *the length of the longest substring of* `s` *such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to* `k`.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** s = "aaabb", k = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** s = "ababbc", k = 2
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= s.length <= 104`
* `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
* `1 <= k <= 105`
