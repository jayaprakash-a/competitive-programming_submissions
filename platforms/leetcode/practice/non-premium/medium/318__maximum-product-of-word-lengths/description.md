# Description

Given a string array `words`, return *the maximum value of* `length(word[i]) * length(word[j])` *where the two words do not share common letters*. If no such two words exist, return `0`.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** words = ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** words = ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The two words can be "ab", "cd".

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** No such pair of words.

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `2 <= words.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 1000`
* `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
