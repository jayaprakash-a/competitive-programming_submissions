# Description

Given 3 positives numbers `a`, `b` and `c`. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of `a` and `b` to make ( `a` OR `b` == `c` ). (bitwise OR operation).  

Flip operation consists of change **any** single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (a OR b == c)
```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** a = 4, b = 2, c = 7
**Output:** 1

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
**Output:** 0

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= a <= 10^9`
* `1 <= b <= 10^9`
* `1 <= c <= 10^9`
