# Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are **sorted in ascending order**, convert it to a height balanced BST.


For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of *every* node never differ by more than 1.


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
**Output:** [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
**Explanation:** One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** head = []
**Output:** []

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** head = [0]
**Output:** [0]

```

**Example 4:**



```

**Input:** head = [1,3]
**Output:** [3,1]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* The number of nodes in `head` is in the range `[0, 2 * 104]`.
* `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
