# Description

In a warehouse, there is a row of barcodes, where the `ith` barcode is `barcodes[i]`.


Rearrange the barcodes so that no two adjacent barcodes are equal. You may return any answer, and it is guaranteed an answer exists.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** barcodes = [1,1,1,2,2,2]
**Output:** [2,1,2,1,2,1]

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** barcodes = [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]
**Output:** [1,3,1,3,1,2,1,2]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= barcodes.length <= 10000`
* `1 <= barcodes[i] <= 10000`
