# Description

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a `target` value in an `m x n` integer `matrix`. The `matrix` has the following properties:


* Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
* Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.


 


**Example 1:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/24/searchgrid2.jpg)

```

**Input:** matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
**Output:** true

```

**Example 2:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/24/searchgrid.jpg)

```

**Input:** matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
**Output:** false

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `m == matrix.length`
* `n == matrix[i].length`
* `1 <= n, m <= 300`
* `-109 <= matix[i][j] <= 109`
* All the integers in each row are **sorted** in ascending order.
* All the integers in each column are **sorted** in ascending order.
* `-109 <= target <= 109`
