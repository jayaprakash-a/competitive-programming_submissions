# Description

Given a string `s`, return *the number of **palindromic substrings** in it*.


A string is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.


A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** s = "abc"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** s = "aaa"
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
