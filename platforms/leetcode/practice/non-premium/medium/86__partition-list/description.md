# Description

Given the `head` of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes **less than** `x` come before nodes **greater than or equal** to `x`.


You should **preserve** the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.


 


**Example 1:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/partition.jpg)

```

**Input:** head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
**Output:** [1,2,2,4,3,5]

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** head = [2,1], x = 2
**Output:** [1,2]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 200]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
* `-200 <= x <= 200`
