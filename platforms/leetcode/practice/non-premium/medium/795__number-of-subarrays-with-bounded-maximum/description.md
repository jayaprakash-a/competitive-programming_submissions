# Description

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `left` and `right`, return *the number of contiguous non-empty **subarrays** such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is in the range* `[left, right]`.


The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** nums = [2,1,4,3], left = 2, right = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three subarrays that meet the requirements: [2], [2, 1], [3].

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** nums = [2,9,2,5,6], left = 2, right = 8
**Output:** 7

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`
* `0 <= left <= right <= 109`
