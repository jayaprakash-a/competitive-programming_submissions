# Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the most frequent **subtree sum**. If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.


The **subtree sum** of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself).


 


**Example 1:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/freq1-tree.jpg)

```

**Input:** root = [5,2,-3]
**Output:** [2,-3,4]

```

**Example 2:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/freq2-tree.jpg)

```

**Input:** root = [5,2,-5]
**Output:** [2]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
* `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
