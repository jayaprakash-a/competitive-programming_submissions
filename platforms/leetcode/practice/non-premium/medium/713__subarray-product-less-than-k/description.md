# Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than* `k`.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** nums = [10,5,2,6], k = 100
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], k = 0
**Output:** 0

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
* `0 <= k <= 106`
