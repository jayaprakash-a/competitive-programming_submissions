# Description

Given an integer n, return *the smallest **prime palindrome** greater than or equal to* `n`.


An integer is **prime** if it has exactly two divisors: `1` and itself. Note that `1` is not a prime number.


* For example, `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11`, and `13` are all primes.


An integer is a **palindrome** if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.


* For example, `101` and `12321` are palindromes.


The test cases are generated so that the answer always exists and is in the range `[2, 2 * 108]`.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** n = 6
**Output:** 7

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** n = 8
**Output:** 11

```
**Example 3:**



```
**Input:** n = 13
**Output:** 101

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= n <= 108`
