# Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the* `k` *most frequent elements*. You may return the answer in **any order**.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
**Output:** [1,2]

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** nums = [1], k = 1
**Output:** [1]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
* It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.


 


**Follow up:** Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.
