# Description

Given an integer array `nums`, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays `left` and `right` so that:


* Every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`.
* `left` and `right` are non-empty.
* `left` has the smallest possible size.


Return *the length of* `left` *after such a partitioning*.


Test cases are generated such that partitioning exists.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** nums = [5,0,3,8,6]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,0,6,12]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 106`
* There is at least one valid answer for the given input.
