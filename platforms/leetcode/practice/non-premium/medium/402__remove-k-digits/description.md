# Description

Given string num representing a non-negative integer `num`, and an integer `k`, return *the smallest possible integer after removing* `k` *digits from* `num`.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** num = "1432219", k = 3
**Output:** "1219"
**Explanation:** Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** num = "10200", k = 1
**Output:** "200"
**Explanation:** Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** num = "10", k = 2
**Output:** "0"
**Explanation:** Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= k <= num.length <= 105`
* `num` consists of only digits.
* `num` does not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
