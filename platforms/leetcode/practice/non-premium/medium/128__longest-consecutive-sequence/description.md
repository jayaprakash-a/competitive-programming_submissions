# Description

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.*


You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
**Output:** 9

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
