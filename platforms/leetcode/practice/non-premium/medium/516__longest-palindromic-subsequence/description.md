# Description

Given a string `s`, find *the longest palindromic **subsequence**'s length in* `s`.


A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** s = "bbbab"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** s = "cbbd"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
