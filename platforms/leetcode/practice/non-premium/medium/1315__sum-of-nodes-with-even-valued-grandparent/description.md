# Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the sum of values of nodes with an **even-valued grandparent***. If there are no nodes with an **even-valued grandparent**, return `0`.


A **grandparent** of a node is the parent of its parent if it exists.


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
**Output:** 18
**Explanation:** The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** root = [1]
**Output:** 0

```

 


**Constraints:**


* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
