# Description

Given an array `nums` with `n` integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying **at most one element**.


We define an array is non-decreasing if `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]` holds for every `i` (**0-based**) such that (`0 <= i <= n - 2`).


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** nums = [4,2,3]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** nums = [4,2,1]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 104`
* `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`
