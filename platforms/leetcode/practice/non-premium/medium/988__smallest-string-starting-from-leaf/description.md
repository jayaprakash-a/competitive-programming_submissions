# Description

You are given the `root` of a binary tree where each node has a value in the range `[0, 25]` representing the letters `'a'` to `'z'`.


Return *the **lexicographically smallest** string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root*.


As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is **lexicographically smaller**.


* For example, `"ab"` is lexicographically smaller than `"aba"`.


A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** root = [0,1,2,3,4,3,4]
**Output:** "dba"

```

**Example 2:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/30/tree2.png)

```

**Input:** root = [25,1,3,1,3,0,2]
**Output:** "adz"

```

**Example 3:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/01/tree3.png)

```

**Input:** root = [2,2,1,null,1,0,null,0]
**Output:** "abc"

```

 


**Constraints:**


* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 8500]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 25`
