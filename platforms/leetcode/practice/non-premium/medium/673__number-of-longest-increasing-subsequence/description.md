# Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the number of longest increasing subsequences.*


**Notice** that the sequence has to be **strictly** increasing.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.


```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`
* `-106 <= nums[i] <= 106`
