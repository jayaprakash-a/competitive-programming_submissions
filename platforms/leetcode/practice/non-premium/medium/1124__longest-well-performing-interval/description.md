# Description

We are given `hours`, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.


A day is considered to be a *tiring day* if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than `8`.


A *well-performing interval* is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.


Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The longest well-performing interval is [9,9,6].

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** hours = [6,6,6]
**Output:** 0

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= hours.length <= 104`
* `0 <= hours[i] <= 16`
