# Description

Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards.


Given an integer array `hand` where `hand[i]` is the value written on the `ith` card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or `false` otherwise.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.


```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= hand.length <= 104`
* `0 <= hand[i] <= 109`
* `1 <= groupSize <= hand.length`
