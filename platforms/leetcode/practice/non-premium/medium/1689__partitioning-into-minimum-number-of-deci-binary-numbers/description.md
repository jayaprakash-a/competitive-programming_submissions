# Description

A decimal number is called **deci-binary** if each of its digits is either `0` or `1` without any leading zeros. For example, `101` and `1100` are **deci-binary**, while `112` and `3001` are not.


Given a string `n` that represents a positive decimal integer, return *the **minimum** number of positive **deci-binary** numbers needed so that they sum up to* `n`*.*


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** n = "32"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 10 + 11 + 11 = 32

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** n = "82734"
**Output:** 8

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** n = "27346209830709182346"
**Output:** 9

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= n.length <= 105`
* `n` consists of only digits.
* `n` does not contain any leading zeros and represents a positive integer.
