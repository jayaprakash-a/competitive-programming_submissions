# Description

Given an array `nums` of integers, we need to find the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.




 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** nums = [3,6,5,1,8]
**Output:** 18
**Explanation:** Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** nums = [4]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.

```

**Example 3:**



```

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 10^4`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
