# Description

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.


We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.


You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
**Output:** [0,0,1,1,2,2]

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** nums = [2,0,1]
**Output:** [0,1,2]

```
**Example 3:**



```
**Input:** nums = [0]
**Output:** [0]

```
**Example 4:**



```
**Input:** nums = [1]
**Output:** [1]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 300`
* `nums[i]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`.
