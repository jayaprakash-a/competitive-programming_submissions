# Description

Given an array of **distinct** integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, return *the number of possible combinations that add up to* `target`.


The answer is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.


 


**Example 1:**



```

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:**
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** nums = [9], target = 3
**Output:** 0

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
* All the elements of `nums` are **unique**.
* `1 <= target <= 1000`


 


**Follow up:** What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?
