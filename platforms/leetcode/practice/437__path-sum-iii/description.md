# Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return *the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals* `targetSum`.


The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).


 


**Example 1:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/pathsum3-1-tree.jpg)

```

**Input:** root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The paths that sum to 8 are shown.

```

**Example 2:**



```

**Input:** root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
**Output:** 3

```

 


**Constraints:**


* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 1000]`.
* `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
* `-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000`
