# Description

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.


You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** nums = [2,2,1]
**Output:** 1

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
**Output:** 4

```
**Example 3:**



```
**Input:** nums = [1]
**Output:** 1

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
* `-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
* Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
