# Description

You are given an array `trees` where `trees[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of a tree in the garden.


You are asked to fence the entire garden using the minimum length of rope as it is expensive. The garden is well fenced only if **all the trees are enclosed**.


Return *the coordinates of trees that are exactly located on the fence perimeter*.


 


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** points = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]
**Output:** [[1,1],[2,0],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2]]

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** points = [[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]
**Output:** [[4,2],[2,2],[1,2]]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= points.length <= 3000`
* `points[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= xi, yi <= 100`
* All the given points are **unique**.
